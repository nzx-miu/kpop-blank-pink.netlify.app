    <p>In general, birds can represent freedom, but cockatoos have their own unique meaning. Also stylized blŒª…îkpi–∏k) is a south korean girl group formed by yg entertainment, consisting of jisoo, jennie, ros√© and lisa. I think this is something to learn.</p>

        <h3>On October 23, 2018, Blackpink Has Officially Signed With The U.s.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>They are singing about being strong and savage, similar to ‚Äúhow you like that.‚Äù. First, lisa appears with smoke wings, then she appears with a cockatoo, followed by ros√© swinging on a chandelier like a bird in a cage. The band debuted on august 8th, 2016 under yg entertainment.</p>
        <h3>Jennie Started As A Trainee At Yg In August 2010 And Trained At The Company Until Blackpink‚Äôs Debut In 2016.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>And if you&#039;re not already go stan them and tell yg to fix his promotion skills because you know what every blink is waiting on square 3 so fix your game yg fix your game. I lived day to day, running towards by dreams.
