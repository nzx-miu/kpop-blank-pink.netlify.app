        <h3>People Are Wonderstruck About How Many Fans Of Bts Must Each Of These Countries Possess To Top This List.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>With almost 70 million followers on instagram, bts takes the crown as that’s way higher than blackpink’s almost 50 million fans on instagram. On the other hand, the blinks came through for the girls in youtube music as they lead the bts boys with more than 7 million subscribers almost 70 million while bts has over 60 million. But, in the case of blinks and army, reports seemingly agree that the “hatred” between the two fandoms has.</p>
        <h3>The Reason For That Is That There Are Many Ways To Show Affection And Bts’s Label Doesn’t Keep Them On A Short Leash.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Before the news about this comeback, many rumors had been floating on the internet that suggested that blackpink would release a new album along with a world tour, or the fact that blackpink would have not one but two comebacks in 2022 alone. Fan wars have existed long before blackpink and bts emerged in the music industry. Europe had 6.57 million fans in.</p>
        <h3>Blackpink Has More Fangirls Than Fanboys.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jeon jungkook of bts is undoubtedly the most popular maknae. With blackpink not releasing any new music in the last 18 months, blinks had become increasingly restless. A person can vote only once in 24 hours.</p>
        <h3>I Am An Army So My Answer May Seem Biased In Some Ways (The Latter), But To Show I Want To Be Fairly Balanced, I’ll Give An Example Of A Toxic Army First:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Considering this now, with the music bank nominations in, blackpink’s “lovesick girls” has been put against bts. With 70.59 million members across 457 fan clubs, asia and oceania took the top spot. Now i’m not too sure that this applies to everyone, basing this off my school, way more people know blackpink than bts.</p>
        <h3>I Am Even Doubting This Because I&#039;m Starting To Feel That.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>While all kpop artists are affectionate with their fans it can be argued that bts is the most affectionate. On the ‘gram, bts takes the lead with over 50 million followers while blackpink follows with about 42 million followers. There were 11.8 million members in 712 fan clubs in north and south america.</p>
