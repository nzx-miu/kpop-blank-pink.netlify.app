        <p>I do find blackpink a little overrated. I&#039;m guessing they&#039;re not for mesubscribe for more videos from sebastine: I think bts works harder than blackpink, so i think they’re more overhyped than overrated (coming from a person who likes bts but they’re nowhere near my top 10).</p>

        <p>I think bts works harder than blackpink, so i think they’re more overhyped than overrated (coming from a person who likes bts but they’re nowhere near my top 10). Yes, i think there are more talented groups out there who don’t get as much recognition, but i think they have more talent than blackpink (sorry major blinks, i still love them).</p>

        <h3>Well Let Me Tell Some Facts, Back Then Blackpink Was Not So Big.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Blackpink is definitely neither overrated nor underrated. People say that blackpink had fans all around the world the second they debuted. Before blinks kill me, hear me y&#039;all.</p>
        <h3>Is Blackpink Overrated?Are People Overrating Blackpink?Enjoyed The Video?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, i think there are more talented groups out there who don’t get as much recognition, but i think they have more talent than blackpink (sorry major blinks, i still love them). Blackpink is the revolution of music industry and they have proved it with every single song. Thanks for watching we’re 71327, ily !!insta—oksoojintiktok—oksoojintwitter—soojinvibe#blackpink #rosé #kpop #parkchaeyoung#lisa #jennie.</p>
        <h3>In The Latest Book Named “Ancestors Of Girl Group”, The.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Probably has been written before tbh but i wanted to write my own i hope you guys don&#039;t mind. So as many international stans would easly answer that question with the answer consisting of twice, red velvet and blackpink. I&#039;m guessing they&#039;re not for mesubscribe for more videos from sebastine:</p>
        <h3>But When It Comes To Results We See Blackpink Members Do Just As Well As Other Idols Not Better Than Them.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I do believe that it&#039;s absolutely not the girls fault to be what. I was definitely one of those people on the blackpink hype train when they were first released. Blackpink worked hard to debut, they did not just pop out of no where.</p>
        <h3>Blackpink/Bts Are Overhyped And Overrated.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>“what is so special about them?” well through this video i. I do find blackpink a little overrated. I think bts works harder than blackpink, so i think they’re more overhyped than overrated (coming from a person who likes bts but they’re nowhere near my top 10).</p>
