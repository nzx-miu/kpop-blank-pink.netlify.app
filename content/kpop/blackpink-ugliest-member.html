        <h3>This Is What I Personally Think After Watching Some Of Blackpink&#039;s Funny Mome.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>On october 23, 2018, blackpink has officially signed with the u.s. Lisa has been undeniably at the top of the list forever, with her rapping, social media savvy, and inherent performance abilities. With this video, our main goal is to spread scientific kno.</p>
        <h3>Blackpink (블랙핑크) Consists Of 4 Members:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It made her to be one of the most hated female kpop idols. I hope you were not expecting a real answer,what made you think of that,huh?one thing i k. This video was created under this.</p>
        <h3>Lisa Has More Than 73 Million Instagram Followers, Which Means She Is The User With The 41St Most Followers In The World And The Highest Among Blackpink Members Who Are Gaining Worldwide Popularity, As Well As Among Korean Female Celebrities.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There she is again,the one wearing yellow.she’s so damn ugly what was yg even thinking? As outlined on a reddit thread, taking all factors into account, it seems like rosé has fallen out of favor as the least popular member of blackpink. Someone claimed she was a bully in high school it was the worst fanfic i&#039;ve ever read in my life.</p>
        <h3>A Youtube Channel By The Name Of Knet Entertainment Made A Video That Showed Some Of These Moments.</h3>
