        <h3>So I’ve Seen A Lot Of Comments Say That If They Do Renew With Yg Then The Girls Themselves Don’t Have A Serious Passion For Music And Actually Like How They’re Managed.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>According to news, jisoo and lisa do not really want to renew their contracts. But the end date of the blackpink contract has not yet been officially announced. Knowing yge and what they did to 2ne1 i wouldn’t be surprised if they’d lay low on promoting bp cuz they’re gonna introduce their new gg soon.</p>
        <h3>It’s Only What My Assumptions Are About What The Future Might Hold.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It’s not like they need it anyway, i mean, look at this: Fans also pointed out that, on june 1, 2020, yg entertainment revealed jisoo ‘s solo single was about to be released. I definitely think blackpink will disband in 2023.</p>
        <h3>Jisoo Is Extremely Passionate About Acting And The Fact She Didn’t Resign??</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I can’t see blackpink being under another label that’s not yg. The reason is that jisoo, who is known for. While there are many hints about a return in the near future, there’s no definite teaser, concept photos, nor schedules about blackpink’s upcoming group activities.</p>
        <h3>Another Thing Yg Doesn’t Allow His Artists To Get Without His Explicit Permission Is Tattoos.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In recent years, it has become a global trend, and its popularity has also increased. Each member of the girl group is worth $8 million, according to celebrity. Blackpink debuted in 2016 and their contract is believed to expire in 2023.</p>
        <h3>They’re All Total Natural Beauties!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The company is already notorious for the bias against females. As of now, pretty high. Therefore, blinks hope blackpink will have at least one more comeback before negotiations for renewal of their contract.</p>
