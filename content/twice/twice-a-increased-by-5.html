        <p>&#039;twice a number increased by 2&#039; is equal to 2n +2 and &#039;the number decreased by 5&#039; equals n − 5. We don&#039;t phrase it this way. Now we must equate these two.</p>

        <h3>&#039;Twice A Number Increased By 2&#039; Is Equal To 2N +2 And &#039;The Number Decreased By 5&#039; Equals N − 5.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Increased = go up, add. Now, we have to modify this equation using the sentence above. Which of the following will most likely result in a decrease in population?</p>
        <h3>What Is Thirty Two Decreased By Twice A Number Is Less The Number Eighteen?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>C2) if this is 1.5 times the original area: Our area will then be a = (140+x) (300+2x) = 42000 + 580x + 2x^2. C1) if we increase the width by x, then we increase the length by twice this amount, or 2x.</p>
        <h3>Repeat The Following Procedure For The Four Given Numbers.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The 1st number is 1. You would need to say increased to more than two times/twice its previous population figures/the population in 1991. This means over 2 times.</p>
        <h3>We Don&#039;t Phrase It This Way.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let&#039;s start by forming an equation of what we know to be true. It decreased by 60% and then increased by 80% c) it increased by 5% and. Twice the number = 2x.</p>
        <h3>Half Of 46 Is 23, That&#039;s Your Answer</h3>
