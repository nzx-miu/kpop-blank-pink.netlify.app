        <p>Breathe it out / i can hear you now / you think reality’s shut you down / and you’re locked away / where you can’t get out / spent awhile on your back / but you. Spent awhile on your back but you know what it means to me, babe in the course of a history, hey it all makes sense to me somehow and it&#039;s not what it used to be, no we&#039;re suddenly free to let go look what&#039;s. I just wanna hear you saying laughing through the day thinking you are never boring speeding through the night maybe you dont count on the morning there&#039;s nothing you can do to keep it out there&#039;s nothing you can do just scream and shout living for today but you just can&#039;t find tomorrow talking &#039;bout the joy but it never stops the sorrow there&#039;s nothing you can do to.</p>
