        <h3>Each Term In An Ap Can Be Represented As :</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let a and d be the first term and common difference of the a.p respectively. 2(m + n) question 4 : Is equal to twice the mth term.</p>
        <h3>8 = 2X Yields Twelve Added To A Number Yields Five.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Because we are multiplying 5 5 times the sum, we need parentheses around the sum of m m and n n. X + 12 = 5 amounts to nine less a number amounts to twenty. Twice = two times 2 Ã—.</p>
        <h3>Now Mth Term [Or T(M.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice the sum of m and n : Is equal to twice the. Translate each word phrase into an algebraic expression:</p>
        <h3>Twice The Sum Of M And N.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This will be written as: The quotient of m and 2 is expressed as \large{{m \over 2}} the product of 4 and n is expressed as 4n 3(m+n) final equation 2(mn) = 3(m+n)</p>
        <h3>Consider Two Numbers â€˜Mâ€™ And â€˜Nâ€™.</h3>

    <p>Is equal to twice the m ^ th term. It is known that the k th term of an a.p. In this case, the unknown numbers are already provided as m and n.</p>
