        <p>It gets charged once you hit confirm. I applied the promotion upon checkout and it showed the discount applied, but a few hours later, i was charged the full price with no discount and the promotion dissappeared from my transaction history (but it&#039;s still in my email). Unfortunately uber isn&#039;t good about refunding.</p>

        <p>There is zero consistency on their end. So i ordered as usual and got charged as usual, food arrives, i decide to tip 15%, a few hours later i get another charge with the added tip ammount.</p>

        <p>It will be enlightening once you see.11.37 amounts indicating uber might have charged them 1% credit card fees or more. They replied with, &#039;an authorization hold is a pending charge placed on your account while we confirm your payment method&#039; and that it would be resolved within a few days.</p>

        <p>If it is a credit card, uber does receive payment and the deduction shows on your credit card bill. In fact i recommend all uber customers to check their weekly/monthly/daily statements.</p>
