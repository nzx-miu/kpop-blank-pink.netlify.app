        <p>Fantasy park&#039; (10) twice in wonderland (1) twicelights (25) touchdown in japan (2) twice 1st tour: I tried to upload this as a whole file, but jyp&#039;s bots took it down after less than 200 views, so i edited each song individually and uploaded it one by one, which took forever, but i have it all in. I wanna get a ticket for this concert but i think it‚Äôs at 2am where i live, and that‚Äôs pretty much impossible for me to watch because of my work hours.</p>

        <p>So the concept of ‚Äúworld in a day‚Äù is fairly obvious, with twice being with all of their fans all at once, and thus ‚Äútravelling the world‚Äù in a sense. I tried to upload this as a whole file, but jyp&#039;s bots took it down after less than 200 views, so i edited each song individually and uploaded it one by one, which took forever, but i have it all in.</p>
