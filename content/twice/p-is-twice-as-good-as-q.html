        <p>The marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve, and it bisects any horizontal line drawn from the vertical axis to the demand curve. P is twice as good as workman as q they both finish in 38 days x/2+1=38 x/3 = 38 x=114,x.is the days required for q q will finish the work in.</p>

        <h3>The Marginal Revenue Curve Is Given By P=10‚àí2Q, Which Is Twice As Steep As The Demand Curve.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A is twice as good workman as b. Together, they do (4+3) =7 ( 4 + 3) = 7 unit of work in a day. = 2x + x = 3x.</p>
        <h3>If P And Q Work Together, How Much Time Will It Take To Complete The Same Work?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The marginal revenue and demand curves in figure 10.5 ‚Äúdemand and marginal revenue‚Äù follow these rules. Click hereüëÜto get an answer to your question Ô∏è \(39) raju is twice as good as vijay. Working together, they can do it in:</p>
        <h3>One Day Work Of P And Q Is ( 3 + 1) = 4 Units.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>P‚Äôs income is 25% more than that of q. P is twice as good at q. A work can be completed by p and q in 12 days, q and r in 15 days, r and p in 20 days.</p>
        <h3>The Share Of Q Is 3/13 Of The Combined Share Of R And P.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Therefore they can complete 7√ó4= 28 7 √ó 4 = 28 units of work in 4 4 days. Let time taken by p be a days and time taken by q be 2a days. Pis twice as good as q.</p>
        <h3>The Number Of Days It Takes For B To Do The Same Piece Of Work, Is :</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>9 11 23 13 ‚áí a can do a certain job in 12 days. Pooja is twice as efficient as aarti and takes 90 days less than aarti to complete the job. B is 60% more efficient than a.</p>
