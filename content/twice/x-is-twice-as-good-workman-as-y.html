        <p>A is twice good as b so the answer should be divided by 2, then the option a turns green. If difference of time is 1 day, b takes 2 days.</p>

        <h3>If Difference Of Time Is 1 Day, B Takes 2 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A is twice as good a workman as b and b is twice as good a workman as c. So, a takes 30 days to do the work. B and c does it in 30 days.</p>
        <h3>I Hope It&#039;s Help You.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>X finished a work in 3 hours less than y. Therefore, y finished the same work in 6 hours. So together they take 18 days.</p>
        <h3>So, We Get 15 ( B + C) = X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Find the time in which they can do it working together. The number of days taken by x alone to finish the same work is correct answer : In how many days can a alone finish the work?</p>
        <h3>If Time Taken By B Be 2X Days Then Time Taken By A = X Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since a is twice good as b so a&#039;s workdone in one day= 2x &amp; b&#039;s workdone in one day= x so, 2x + x = 1/18 3x = 1/18 x = 1/54 so, b&#039;s workdone in oneday= 1/54 &amp;. A is twice good as b so the answer should be divided by 2, then the option a turns green. Let a takes x days and b takes y days to finish the work.</p>
        <h3>As Per Question A Will Take \Begin{Aligned} 2* \Frac{3}{4} * X = \Frac.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>X is twice as efficient as y and y is 50% more efficient than z. (a + b)&#039;s 1 day&#039;s work = 1/30 + 1/60 = 1/20. Then c can do it by himself in.</p>
