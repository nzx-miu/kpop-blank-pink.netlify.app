        <p>Twice differentiable functions can be thrice differentiable. A function may be differentiable at a point but not twice differentiable (i.e., the first derivative exists, but the second derivative does not). Particularly, if a function f(x) is differentiable at x=a , then f′(a) exists in the domain.</p>

    <p>Particularly, if a function f(x) is differentiable at x=a , then f′(a) exists in the domain. The differentiation of a function is a way to show the rate of change of a function at a given point. Actually what you say as “twice differentiable” is nothing other than “double derivative”.</p>
        <h3>The Absolute Value Function Is Not Differentiable At 0 Because The Graph Of The Function Has A Sharp Corner At This Point.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For example the absolute value function is actually continuous (though not differentiable) at x=0. Differentiable ⇒ continuous but a function can be continuous but not differentiable. In other words, it&#039;s the set of all real numbers that are not equal to zero.</p>
        <h3>Its Domain Is The Set { X ∈ R:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The above is a substitute static image. What does twice differentiable mean? Visually it is the slope of that curve at that point.</p>
        <h3>Twice Differentiable Functions Can Be Thrice Differentiable.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This device cannot display java animations. An example of this slope is the red line at the red dot where the function or curve. Functions like $e^{x}, \sin x $ are infinitely differentiable functions or $c^{\infty}$ functions.</p>
        <h3>When A Function Is Differentiable It Is Also Continuous.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>One way to define second differentiable at a point x would be the existence of a quadratic function ah 2 + bh such that f (x+h) = f (x) + bh + ah 2 + o (h 2 ), i.e. What does it mean when a function is twice differentiable? A function may be differentiable at a point but not twice differentiable (i.e., the first derivative exists, but the second derivative does not).</p>
