        <h3>2) Do I Need To Include Then Before Use The Colours I Suggest. Wonder123 1) Is The Second If In The Above Sentence Required?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I would certainly not use an ampersand. If ‘respectively’ comes in the middle of a sentence, it should be both preceded and followed by a comma : I like movies, traveling and going out with friends.</p>

You certainly can usage and much more than as soon as in a sentence, yet in this situation i would take into consideration rewording it in which method instead.</p>
        <h3>This Type Of Construction Is Very Common In Spoken English.</h3>
    <br/>
