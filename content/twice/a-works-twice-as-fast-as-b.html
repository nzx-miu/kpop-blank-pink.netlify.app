        <p>2 12 = 1 6 (as given a works twice as fast as b) so, when a and b work together the work done by them in one day will be. Let us consider work done by b in 1 day = x.</p>

        <h3>If B Can Complete A Work In 12 Days Independently.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>1.&#039;a&#039; works twice as fast as &#039;b&#039;. A works twice as fast as b if b can complete a work in 12 days independently then the number of days in which a and b can together finish the work is medium view solution &gt; a and b working together can finish a piece of work in 6 days, while a alone can do it in 9 days. ∵ a works twice as fast as b∴ time taken to complete the work by a = 6 daysa and b together finish the work in = hence, time taken by a and b together to finish the work = 4 days</p>
        <h3>Work Is Done By A In 1 Day = 2X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If both of them together take 6 days to complete the work, in how many days can &#039;b&#039; alone complete the same? If both of them can together finish a piece of work. He can complete in 6 days.</p>
        <h3>Work Done = Time Taken × Rate Of Work.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So he does (1/x)th of the work in a day. When they work together they complete 5b portion of the work. Now, work done by both a and b together in 1 day= 1/12.</p>
        <h3>Set Your Child Up For Success With Lido, Book A Class Today!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let x be a time taken. 1 so, ratio of times taken = 1: Correct option is a) ratio of rates of working of a and b = 2 :</p>
        <h3>As, A Works Twice As Fast As B, So, B’s Effort For The Work Is 0.5X (Per Day) Thus , In A Day Both A &amp; B Spend 1.5X Amount Of Effort.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If both of them can together finish a work in 12 days, b alone can do it in.a)40 days b)27 daysc)36 days d)24 dayse)none of thesecorrect answer is option &#039;c&#039;. A works twice as fast as b and b works twice as fast as c. ∴ a&#039;s one day&#039;s work = 61.</p>
