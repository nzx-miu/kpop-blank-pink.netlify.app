    <p><strong>+13 A Is Twice Efficient Than B References</strong>. Ratio of efficiency 3 : A can finish the work in 30 days let assume a can finish the work in “ x “ days b can finish the work in “ 2 x “ days together a and b can finish the [ (1/x) + (1/2 x)]th portion of work in one day [ (1/x) + (1/2 x) ] = (1/20) , hence [3/ (2 x) = ( 1/20)] or 2 x = 6.</p>

        <p>Then find in how many days, a alone can complete the work?correct answer is &#039;10.5&#039;. Efficiency of a = 120% of efficiency of b ⇒ efficiency of a = (6/5) of efficiency of b ⇒ (efficiency of a)/(efficiency of b) = 6/5.</p>

        <h3>In What Time Can B Complete The Work?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Then find in how many days a alone can complete the work? B=number of days taken by b, then efficiency of b = 1/b. So a:b = 2:1 also (a+b) one day work = 1/18 to get days in which b will finish the work, lets calculate work done by b in 1 day = \begin{aligned} =\left(\frac{1}{18}*\frac{1}{3} \right) \\ = \frac{1}{54} \end{aligned} [please note we multiplied by 1/3 as per b share and total of ratio is 1/3] so b will finish the work in 54 days</p>
        <h3>A And B Work Together For 8 Days And Thereafter, A Is Replaced By C.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A is twice as efficient as b and b is thrice as efficient as c, who can finish a job alone in 24 days. [a] 10.5 [b] 11 [c] 14 [d] 21 [e] none of these. A is 20% more efficient than b.</p>
        <h3>Find 6 Answers &amp; Solutions For The Question A Is Twice As Efficient As B And B Is Twice As Efficient As C.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>10.5 days how it comes : If c and d can complete the work in 20 and 30 daysrespectively, working alone ,then in how many days a can complete the work individually: A is twice efficient as b and together they do the same work in as much time as c and d together.</p>
        <h3>Efficiency Of C = 3 × 1 = 3.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As per question, a do twice the work as done by b. (1/a) = 2 (1/b) b is thrice as efficient as c. A is twice as efficient as b and b is thrice.</p>
        <h3>Yes (10) | No (2) Sagar Kumar (6 Years Ago) As A:b=2:1,B:c=3:1 (Efficiency) Time Ratio To Do The Work=1:2,1:3 So A Can Complete In 4D,B Can Compete In 6D As Mentioned C In 24D.a+B+C 3 Day Work=1/4+1/8+1/24=5/12.So 5/12*2=10/12 Means A+B+C 6 Days Work=10/12.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Remaining work b will complete in. Efficiency of a = 120% of efficiency of b ⇒ efficiency of a = (6/5) of efficiency of b ⇒ (efficiency of a)/(efficiency of b) = 6/5. [a] 24 [b] 25 [c] 27 [d] 30</p>
