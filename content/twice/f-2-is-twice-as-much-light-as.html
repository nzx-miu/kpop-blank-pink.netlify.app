    <p><strong>+13 F/2 Is Twice As Much Light As References</strong>. For example, f4 allows about twice as much light into the camera as f5.6. So, your real world calculation would be almost twice as.</p>

        <p>You’re shooting at f/2.8, at 1/100 of a second, with an iso of 200 but you want a very shallow depth of field. Always remember that smaller f stop numbers allow more light into the camera than the larger f stop numbers. (subject, foreground, and background) will be in focus.</p>

        <p>A full stop in either direction will allow twice as much light, or half as much light to reach the image sensor. For example, f4 allows twice as much light to reach the cameras&#039; image sensor than f5.6.</p>

        <p>If you adjust your shutter speed to allow twice as much light (from 1/60 to 1/30), both the final exposure and the original exposure will both allow the exact same amount of light to reach the sensor. The smartphone manufacturers are fighting this fight now in their marketing because the resolution fight is kind of done, they take high enough res photos for most of what you do.</p>

        <p>For example, f4 allows twice as much light to reach the cameras&#039; image sensor than f5.6. As you can see the shutter speed in each case has been made twice as long (1/500s vs 1/1000s at f4).</p>

        <h3>On The Other Hand, F11 Allows About Half As Much Light Into The Camera As F8.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For example, f4 allows twice as much light to reach the cameras&#039; image sensor than f5.6. The smartphone manufacturers are fighting this fight now in their marketing because the resolution fight is kind of done, they take high enough res photos for most of what you do. (f/2, f/4, and f/10 respectively for the above examples).</p>
        <h3>F/2 Is Twice As Much Light As F/2.8.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Standard lenses are usually rated between f/1.8 and f/16. So a f/1.0 lens can let in about twice the light that a lens that says f/2.2 can. This hole is called the aperture.</p>
        <h3>Respond Faster With A F2.8 Lens.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is because iso100 is half as sensitive to light compared to iso200 and we therefore need twice as much light to hit the sensor, which can be achieved by using a shutter speed that is twice as long or by doubling the size of the aperture. You’re shooting at f/2.8, at 1/100 of a second, with an iso of 200 but you want a very shallow depth of field. So what does that have to do with speed?</p>
        <h3>I Thought You’d Never Ask!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Lens 2 has a maximum. Lens 1 has a maximum aperture of f/2.8. F/1.4 is four times as much light as f/2.8.</p>
        <h3>1/2 As Much Light As The Original Exposure.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Apertures are expressed in ‘f’ numbers — the higher the number the smaller the aperture. (subject, foreground, and background) will be in focus. These blades form a hole through which light can pass through before hitting the camera’s sensor or film.</p>
