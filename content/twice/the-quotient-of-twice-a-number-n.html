        <h3>So We Get The Quotient Value As 6 And Remainder 0.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>3 + 6n = 51: (e) the sum of twice a number and twenty is smaller than three times the number plus seven. To find the quotient, you have to divide 36 by 6.</p>
        <h3>In This Case We Have To Divide Twice A Number (A Number X Multiplied By 2) By 7.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Feel free to ask for more if needed or if you did not understand something. Twice the number = 2x. The answer after we divide one number by another.</p>
