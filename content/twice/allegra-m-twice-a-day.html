        <h3>It Took Me A Long Time To Realise That This Medication Was The Reason For Massively Increased Palpitations And Ectopic Beats, As It Took A Couple Of Weeks For It To Get Really Bad After Starting 180Mg Twice A Day.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Relieve your hay fever and allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy, watery eyes, itchy nose, or itchy throat. If you have a sinus infection with inspissated mucus, you need to promote mucus drainage by nasal irrigations with warm salt water and instilling nasal decongestant sprays. If a 24 hour formulation of allegra is not providing the desired effects, there are other options to consider for treating your seasonal allergic rhinitis:</p>
        <h3>It Would Be Better To Add In From Another Drug Class.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The favoured dose of allegra for adults and children (12 years of age and older) is 60 mg every 12 hours or 120 mg once daily. Patients also experienced less fatigue, nausea, and throat irritations with allegra. Tabletwise.com website users have reported once a day and twice a day as the most common frequency of using allegra m tablet.</p>
        <h3>Adults And Children 12 Years And Older The Recommended Dose Of Allegra Tablets Is 60 Mg Twice Daily Or 180 Mg Once Daily With Water.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you are using the liquid form of this medication, shake the bottle well before each. A dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function [see clinical pharmacology (12.3 )]. Let me know if you have other questions.</p>
        <h3>The Recommended Dose Of Allegra Tablets Is 60 Mg Twice Daily Or 180 Mg Once Daily With Water.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Effective antibiotics are also needed for most severe sinus infections. I used to get shots,then eventually allegra twice daily and finally allegra d 24 hrs.when i think ,how i used to suffer with the itchy eyes,headaches,running. Allegra 120 mg tablet is generally used once or twice a day, as the time interval to which this medication has an impact, is around 12 to 24 hours, but it is not the standard frequency, for using this medication.</p>
        <h3>Nope, Just Don&#039;t Take It At 11 Pm And Again At 1 Am And Say Well, Its Says Once A Day!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Nausea all day and night. You can take plain allegra twice daily. But at your age, it&#039;s a bad idea to double up on your allegra, and even your current daily dose may be too high.</p>
