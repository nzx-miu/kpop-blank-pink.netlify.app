        <p>You`ll end up shooting for 2.5 weeks before pct and that`s fine. The vial expires 30 days after mixing. Some men feel that it is more natural to keep the testes functioning and perhaps more safe as well.</p>

        <p>There is also a lot of information saying not to have them if you have. Hcg is best dosed at 500 iu and/or 1000iu, more than that can cause too much aromatization, and some people won&#039;t react to less than 500iu.</p>

        <p>Well so far hcg is not working testicles considerably smaller and my load size is a 3 rd of its normal size. I&#039;ve been looking online at the side effects of the hcg shots and found some disturbing information with regards to hcg shots (during pregnancy) being linked to severe birth defects.</p>

        <h3>Ok On Trt 200 Mgs A Week Split Injections Mon And Thur.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Drop the deca at week 14, and drop the test at week 16 and you`re going to use the hcg the two weeks after your last test shot and before you start your pct. Hcg looks good in all other parameters. I waited a few weeks to start hcg and this is the start of my 2nd week on hcg.</p>
        <h3>I Don&#039;t Know Who Likes To Inject That Much!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The vial expires 30 days after mixing. When to inject hcg when dosing testosterone twice a week hidden secrets about male enhancement underwear exposed women that take testosterone pills, best supplements for testosterone and libido testosterone cyprionate how much is paid by medicare should i take a testosterone booster if im not working out. 500iu 2x/week is on the higher end of the dosing spectrum, but certainly not unheard of.</p>
        <h3>Berger’s Recommended Protocol For Early Pregnancy Monitoring.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>During treatment, the frequency of hmg injections was increased to twice a week in six patients who still had not produced normal sperm counts. I&#039;ll have them twice a week until the end of week 8 and then once a week until week 12. Store the hcg in the refrigerator after it is mixed.</p>
        <h3>Say For Example You Went To 400.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There is also a lot of information saying not to have them if you have. 500iu has an effective life about 3 days long. Not only will it help to promote healthy sperm, but it.</p>
        <h3>100Mg Twice A Week, I Usually Do Tue/Fri And No Hcg.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Up until about one week ago i was feeling great on it but recently i have noticed a drop in. Some men need to go up to 500 iu twice per week to experience any increase in testicular volume. That protocol requires, when you add injections up, five injections a week.</p>
