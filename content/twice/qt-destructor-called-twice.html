        <h3>Qt Provides A Sophisticated Property System Similar To The Ones Supplied By Some Compiler Vendors.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The copy constructor is called twice, once when the object x is send as a parameter and second when x is returned from the function. When a qobject is created with an object as the parent object, the object will be added to the children() list of the parent object. Same situation when the qcustomplot destructor gets called i get a .invalid address specified to rtlvalidateheap(., which is the debugger detecting a heap problem.</p>
        <h3>Then,Quitthe Destructor Of The Local Variable Is Called Again, That Is To Sayquitthe Destructor Of Was Called Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Object deletion was requested by a call to deletelater () here is what i get in the stack trace: Qsharedpointer::create() improperly calls the destructor when the constructor throws an exception. I am debugging an app which crashes when an object is being deleted.</p>
        <h3>When Qobjects Are Created On The Stack, The Same Behavior Applies.</h3>

        <h3>The Destructor Is Not Being Called In Multiple Threads.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The call is like this: Normally, the order of destruction still doesn’t. Is it bug in qt or mine logic?</p>
        <h3>When Any Qobject In The Tree Is Deleted, If The Object Has A Parent, The Destructor Automatically Removes The Object From Its Parent.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the object has children, the destructor automatically deletes each child. When qobjects are created on the stack, the same behavior applies. When any qobject in the tree is deleted, if the object has a parent, the destructor automatically removes the object from its parent.</p>
