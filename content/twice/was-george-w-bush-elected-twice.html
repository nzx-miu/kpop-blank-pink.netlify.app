        <h3>Kerry Wasn&#039;t A Terribly Good Opponent &amp; Bush Had The Advantage By Not Only Being The Incumbent But Being The Incumbent During Wartime.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Bush was given a disputed second term. Jeb bush and grandson of the late former president george h.w. It would be more accurate to say he got the office than that he won.</p>
        <h3>In 2004, Bush Was Up Against Kerry.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In both cases the other side conceeded the election. He was elected to congress in 1982. But the historic controversy over the 2004 election has not ended.</p>
        <h3>I Think A Lot Of Shit Is Wrapped Up With That Family And A Lot Of Very Very Wealthy People Depend On Their Machinations To Gain The System.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the senate. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. He had a son who served two terms and served them only.</p>
        <h3>Yeah I Know Some Democratic Partisans Hold That If They Kept Counting And Recounting The Votes, Eventually They Would Win.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I don&#039;t even think jeb bush wants to run in 2016, but i bet there&#039;s an invisible hand that will force him. The truthful, if wiseacre answer is cause he legally won the 2000 &amp; 2004 elections for president. In 2000, al gore actually got more votes and junior only got the office because.</p>
        <h3>On Election Night, The Media Prematurely Declared A Winner Twice, Based On Exit Polls.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>1 day agovoters brushed off his indictment when they reelected him in 2018. But he ran into trouble within the state gop over his indecisive. Bush won a second term with 51% of the vote and republicans held on to their congressional majorities.</p>
