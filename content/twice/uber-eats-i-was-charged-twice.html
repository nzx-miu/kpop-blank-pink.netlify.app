        <p>This is because when you first placed the order, we put a temporary charge, which acts as a hold, with your payment method. Report a violation file your complaint I literally paid $90 for a pizza, an order of potato skins and a brownie.</p>

        <p>This does not mean you were charged twice. From time to time, uber will seem to charge you twice or even thrice the same amount for what appears to be the same ride.</p>

        <p>If this happens, we recommend confirming that you haven&#039;t taken separate trips that happened to have the same fare. Your uber account or payment account may occasionally show 2 or more identical charges for the same amount.</p>

        <p>Why did i get charged twice for uber eats? To check if this is valid, choose history in the uber app menu on your device.</p>

        <h3>All Went Through As Usual.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have a duplicate charge. I placed an order to pay cash because the app was not deducting the cost from my credit for some reason. For security reasons, we may occasionally verify that your payment method is valid.</p>
        <h3>Why Did I Get Charged Twice For Uber Eats?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Click on them and select &#039;support messages.&#039;. So i ordered as usual and got charged as usual, food arrives, i decide to tip 15%, a few hours later i get another charge with the added tip ammount. All they need is to steal $10 from each rider in a month.</p>
        <h3>They Said Is Was Just Something That Happens At Times.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I&#039;m a regular user, but have a problem with an order from december 19. This is because when you first placed the order, we put a temporary charge, which acts as a hold, with your payment method. Once for the initial amount without the tip and a second time with my initial order + tip.</p>
        <h3>Credit My $45 And Apologize.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But the money has already went through, and i can&#039;t afford another order charge so it declined, i read up about authorisation. You can also contact us with the form below. In fact i recommend all uber customers to check their weekly/monthly/daily statements.</p>
        <h3>I Filed A Complaint With Uber Eats, And They Did Nothing Exceptblow Me Off.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Uber eats multiple charges for single order if your concern relates to being charged for a cancelled order or being charged twice for the same order, it is most likely an authorization hold. The most common answer is to telephone paypal support. My account has an unrecognized charge.</p>
