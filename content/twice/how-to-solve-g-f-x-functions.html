        <p>Learn how to solve f(g(x)) by replacing the x found in the outside function f(x) by g(x). To find the answers, all i have to do is apply the operations (plus, minus, times, and divide) that they tell me to, in the order that they tell me to. So f of g of x, is also a function of x.</p>

        <p>What is g of f of x? So f of g of x is a square root of, and we could write this as x squared over 1 plus x squared, but we could just leave it like this.</p>

    <p>He then adds these functions together, with the equation (f+g)(x). Because the input value is a number, 2, we can use algebra to simplify. Notice how the letters stay in the same order in each expression for the composition.</p>
        <h3>That Is, Replacing \ (X\) In The Example Above With Another Function.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So f of g of x, is also a function of x. F ( 2) = 2 2 + 3 ( 2) − 4 = 4 + 6 − 4 = 6 f ( 2) = 2 2 + 3 ( 2) − 4 = 4 + 6 − 4 = 6. And finally multiplication, which is (ftimesg)(x).</p>
        <h3>It Is A Different Way Of Writing Y In Equations, But It&#039;s Much More Useful!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>What is g of f of x? It&#039;s equal to the square root of this whole thing, x over 1 plus x, squared, minus one. (f o g) (x) = f (g (x)) and is read “f composed with g of x” or “f of g of x”.</p>

    <p>Learn how to solve f(g(x)) by replacing the x found in the outside function f(x) by g(x). Divide each side by &#039;x&#039;. How to solve equations of the form fg(x)=gf(x)maths revision videosnew gcse maths curriculum</p>
