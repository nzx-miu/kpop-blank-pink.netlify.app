        <h3>1) Tamara Has 35 Coins In Nickels And Quarters.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>10q + 25q = 490 ie 35q = 490 so q = 14 and n must be 28. That adds up to $5.00. There are twice as many quarters as there are dimes.</p>
        <h3>So 0.25Q + 0.10D + 0.05N = 4.75.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Answer provided by our tutors number of nickels = 2x. 5n + 10n + 25n = 340 n + 3n + 2n = 340 5n + 30n + 50n = 340 weegy: Helen has twice as many dimes as nickels.</p>
        <h3>Monica Has Three Times As Many Nickels As Pennies And Twice As Many Quarters As Nickels.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>And 82 nickels = $4.10. The number of nickels is four times the number of quarters. N + q = 35.</p>
