        <p>And it&#039;s definitely javascript problem because if you hit google and search for event fire twice you will see that angular, jquery and backbone etc all are somewhere firing events twice or even thrice. This means setting up a jquery function to handle the click event.</p>

        <p>Jquery click event fires twice. If a focus event was fired below the element handling the event, it will be bubbled as a focusin and must be attached as such if it&#039;s a bound (vs delegated) event.</p>

        <p>It&#039;s possible that focusin firing twice is correct. I tested on win7 chrome, it is fired twice, and in win7 opera/safari it&#039;s fired once.</p>

        <p>So, it&#039;s seem that it&#039;s javascript behind this. Iframe, javascript, vue.js the function bound to ( @load=myfunction) fires once when the iframe is created and once when it’s actually loaded.</p>

        <p>The browser decides when to trigger &#039;resize&#039;. If a focus event was fired below the element handling the event, it will be bubbled as a focusin and must be attached as such if it&#039;s a bound (vs delegated) event.</p>

        <p>[jquery] event firing twice in using jquery • 13 years ago i am attaching an event to a link. [ beautify your computer :</p>
    </aside>
</section>
<section>
        <h3>However, When The Link Is Clicked, The Event Is Run Twice (Div Opens And Then Closes Immediately).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>With the following code, i would get two logs in the console: Well for some reason it seems to be firing twice and appending twice when its just simply in a $(document).ready(function() {}); If a focus event was fired below the element handling the event, it will be bubbled as a focusin and must be attached as such if it&#039;s a bound (vs delegated) event.</p>
        <h3>And It&#039;s Definitely Javascript Problem Because If You Hit Google And Search For Event Fire Twice You Will See That Angular, Jquery And Backbone Etc All Are Somewhere Firing Events Twice Or Even Thrice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Fact that it seems as though the code below is. The slight difference would be the click event was fired twice vs the same click event bound to the element. Nothing to do with jquery.</p>
        <h3>Here&#039;s A Simple Solution To The Problem Using Settimeout.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>And you can use window.onresize = function () {.} to test. The focus and blur events are not defined to bubble by the w3c, so as a convenience we translate them to focusin and focusout. This question has been asked/answered (mostly) before, but i’ve tried three things to stop the event from bubbling but nothing has worked:</p>
        <h3>So, It&#039;s Seem That It&#039;s Javascript Behind This.</h3>

        <h3>Input Fires Keypress Event Twice No.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Input fires keypress event twice tags: You can’t just switch the asp:button to and html button because you want to control the button visibility from the code behind. Comment:3 changed 15 years ago by john</p>
