        <p>The mnet asian music awards went online for their 22nd edition this weekend. Initially i was peeved because twice was getting the classic girl group treatment with the shortened songs, the rushed/awkward transitions, but this song made me forget all that. Before hitting the stage for the award, the members first took the red carpet by storm with their modern outfits!</p>
