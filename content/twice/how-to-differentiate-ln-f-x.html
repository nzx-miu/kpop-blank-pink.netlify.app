        <p>If you want to know the derivative of ln x at x = 2, then the answer is 1/2, since the derivative of f(x) = ln x is f&#039;(x) = 1/x and when you evaluate that at x = 2, you get f&#039;(2} = 1/2. Start with the formula for f, which is f (tan (x)) = sin (x) differentiate implicitly (using the chain rule on the lhs) giving f’ (tan (x)) sec² (x) = cos (x) rearrange as f’ (tan (x)) = ±1 / sec³ (x) = ±1 / [sec² (x)]^ (3/2) = ±1 / [1+tan² (x)]^ (3/2) replace tan (x) by x. G (x) = \ln \big (f (x)\big).</p>

    <p>F (x)=ln (√x) is a composition of the functions ln (x) and √x, and therefore we can differentiate it using the chain rule. The derivative of ln ( x) is 1/ x, so f ( x) = 1/ x. Differentiation of a function f(x) recall that to diﬀerentiate any function, f(x), from ﬁrst principles we ﬁnd the slope, δy δx, of the line joining an arbitrary point, a, and a neighbouring point, b, on the graph of f(x).</p>
        <h3>We Can Use The Chain Rule Here, Naming U=2X And Remembering That The Chain Rule States That.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You use the chain rule : Since f‘(x)=1/x and g‘(x)=2, we have : Derivative ofln ⁡ f ( x)\ln {f (x)} ln f (x) since this is a composite function, we can differentiate it using chain rule.</p>
        <h3>The Derivative Of The Logarithm Is D Dx Ln(X) = 1 X So The F &#039;[G(X)] = 1 Ln(X) And The G&#039;(X) = 1 X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>What are ln and log? The derivative of the natural logarithmic function (ln [x]) is simply 1 divided by x. You have to apply the chain rule that tells us d dx f [g(x)] = f &#039;[g(x)]g&#039;(x).</p>
        <h3>D ⁄ Dx Ln [F (X)] = F&#039; (X) ⁄ F (X) = 2X ⁄ X2 + 5.</h3>

    <p>The derivative calculator supports computing first, second,., fifth derivatives as well as differentiating functions with many variables (partial derivatives), implicit differentiation and calculating roots/zeros. Hence log ( ln x ) = ln ( ln x ) / ln (10) and then differentiating this gives [1/ln (10)] * [d (ln (ln x)) / dx].
