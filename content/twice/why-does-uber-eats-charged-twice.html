        <p>Some of the possible situations that can cause an uber double charge include the following: When there are more orders in a certain area than delivery people who are able to deliver them, the delivery fee may be higher than usual to ensure you can still get the items you want, when you want it.</p>

        <h3>Getting An Uber Eats Refund Has Never Been Easier!.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I signed to to uber and i got charged? You should also check out the menu prices on those apps versus the store menu too. I&#039;ve had this happen twice in the last month.</p>
        <h3>If You Believe You Have Duplicate Charges, Please Check That There Is No Corresponding Trip Or Fare Adjustment.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How do i leave my driver a tip? Your app will let you know when there aren&#039;t enough delivery people in a particular area. What looks like an extra or duplicate charge on a trip is likely an authorization hold.</p>
        <h3>I Can’t Tell You About Most People.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I&#039;ve used them several times since december with no issue. Once you do so, you should hopefully be able to ride! What you want a tip because you did your job and didn&#039;t spit in my food on the way?</p>
        <h3>Delivery Fees Administered By Companies.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Giving cash directly to your driver is also an option. When there are more orders in a certain area than delivery people who are able to deliver them, the delivery fee may be higher than usual to ensure you can still get the items you want, when you want it. Good day uber eats are rogues, who double charges you, yesterday 15.02.2020,my wife had order meals from mcdonald&#039;s cornubia, to be delived, using uber eats.</p>
        <h3>Probably Cause The Support Doesn&#039;t Know Enough English To Understand Your Problem.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If this happens, we recommend confirming that you haven&#039;t taken separate trips that happened to have the same fare. You are free to add a tip, and drivers are free to accept tips. When you asked for details of why it was refusing a refund, you say you were told it was because of suspicious activity on.</p>
