        <h3>Then The Time In Which They Can Complete The Work Together?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>(a+b)&#039;s 1 day&#039;s work= 1/9 + 1/18 = 1/6. The area of this region (a) is independent of m. C) both do the same amount of positive work.</p>
        <h3>If A Can Complete The Work In 8 Days, Then To Complete The Work B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Thereofore, if x is the number of hours worker a needs to finish a job, and y is the number of hours worker b needs to finish a job, then the statement worker a works n times faster than. Ratio of rates of working of a and b =2:1. (b) increases as m increases.</p>
        <h3>Which One Of The Following Statements Is Correct?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So, x and y can complete the work in 4 days. ( )n nlog o n( )2 o n( )2 o n( )2 n2. Working together they will complete the work in = 24/(1 + 2) =24/3=8 days.</p>
        <h3>In Your Case Above, X &lt;&lt;Strong&gt; Y&lt;/Strong&gt; So It Would Be A Percentage Less Than 100%.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When the area in square units of an expanding circle is increasing twice as fast as its radius in. Then in 1 day x will do 2 units of work where as y will do 1 units of work X = 24, k = 2.</p>
        <h3>D) Both Do Zero Work.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hence, &#039;4&#039; is the correct naswer. A) both do positive work, but person x does four times the work of person y. T1 / t2 = (100 / 50) = twice as fast = 200%.</p>
