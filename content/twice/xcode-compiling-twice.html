        <p>To execute tests, xcode launches your application, then injects the test bundle into the running application! Xcode will clean your project and remove any cached data so everytime you try to archive your app, it&#039;ll compile everything from scratch. The first option involves using xcode as an editor only to write your source code, and using the gcc command within the terminal window to compile your code.</p>

        <p>I am running xcode version 10.1 (10b61), mojave 10.14 (18a391) i see this problem go away if i remove the last model added in core data. Reduces build time because you’re no longer compiling the same code twice;</p>

        <p>This means that your compile sources phase can start earlier providing your some parallelization for free. But so far i like very much coding by shell commands.</p>

        <h3>There Are A Lot Of Project Types To Choose From.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I am running xcode version 10.1 (10b61), mojave 10.14 (18a391) i see this problem go away if i remove the last model added in core data. In this case, we’re using provenance. Compiling locally on the m1 mac isn&#039;t the issue but i had to find a way to reduce the build time for.</p>
        <h3>To Compile Each File Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The first option involves using xcode as an editor only to write your source code, and using the gcc command within the terminal window to compile your code. The two architectures are compiled and linked separately and then compiled into a fat executable. To execute tests, xcode launches your application, then injects the test bundle into the running application!</p>
        <h3>I Found This Similar Issue:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Great, now that xcode is installed, you have two options for developing and running c programs on your mac. Launch xcode 7, click agree, and wait for it to finish installing components. Xcode will clean your project and remove any cached data so everytime you try to archive your app, it&#039;ll compile everything from scratch.</p>
        <h3>Currently, As Of Xcode 6.1.1, Swift Is Only Officially Supported In Essentially Two Types Of Targets:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Then run the compiled file, type./main then you should see the results of the code like you saw from your class. (the duplicate compiles for armv6 and armv7 are perfectly normal. You can locate build active architecture only setting under build settings.</p>
        <h3>Choose File &gt; New Project To Create A New Project.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This will prevent xcode to compile files twice. If i back out the new item, the build succeeds, but once a class is added with a to many relationship, the build fails. Keep in mind there very likely are some differences between c compilers in visual c++ and gcc in xcode.</p>
