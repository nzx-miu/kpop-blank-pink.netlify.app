    <p>How human papillomavirus (hpv) is spread. It&#039;s also possible to be infected with a different strain of hpv. Dormant hpv probably isn’t spreadable.</p>
        <h3>Hpv Has No Symptoms, So You May Not Know If You Have It.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The most recent research says that once you clear an hpv strain, your body then develops an immunity to that strain; You do not need to have penetrative sex. However, hpv can lie dormant in the body and recur later in life.</p>
        <h3>The Observation Of Hpv Infection At Older Ages May Be Explained By Reactivation Of A Latent Infection Or New Exposure From Sexual Activity.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Request vaccine going back for a colposcopy Some can cause warts and verrucas. Children aged 9 through 14 years who have received two doses of hpv vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose.</p>
        <h3>When Hpv Infection Goes Away The Immune System Will Remember That Hpv Type And Keep A New Infection Of The Same Hpv Type From Occurring Again.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Vaginal, anal or oral sex; 1 once you have gotten rid of an hpv infection, you&#039;re less likely to be reinfected, though it&#039;s still possible. But when my gynecologist asked if i’d like to be tested for hpv, i agreed to do so since i was already there.</p>
        <h3>Yes You Can I Have A Paste I Well Put Here For You To Read Over 100 Different Types Of Hpv And It Can Go As Long As 2 Years Or More Before They Have Any Symptoms Even Catch It From A Person By Hand Shaking Or Touching Something They Have Touched You Would Be Doing Him A Big Favor By Telling Him.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, scientists are unsure whether it. In other words, it is the persistence of hpv — defined as consecutively positive hpv results at least 12 months apart — rather than the presence of. That’s because hpv can stay dormant for years before it starts causing the cell damage that can lead to cancer.</p>
