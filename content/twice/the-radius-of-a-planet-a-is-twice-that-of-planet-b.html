        <h3>Their Radii R A And R B Are Such That R A :</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, planet b has twice the radius of planet a. A) m/sqrt (2) b) m c) msqrt (2) d) 4m e) m/4. Two planets a and b have the same average density.</p>
        <h3>If G A And G B Are The Acceleration Due To Gravity At The Surfaces Of The Planets, The G A :.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of earth is ge. Two planets, planet a and planet b, have the same surface gravity. If the mass and radius of planet are twice the earth, then time period of second pendulum on planet will be (a) 1 s (b) 2 s (c) 2</p>
        <h3>The Mass Of Planet B Is Four Times The Mass Of</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A planet has its mass and radius twice that of earth. ⇒ g m a r a 2 = g m b r b 2. M b = 2m a and r a = r.</p>
        <h3>Acceleration Due To Gravity, G = G M R 2.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The radius of a planet is twice the radius of earth. The mass of planet b is equal to the mass of planet a. `∴ g_a = (gm_a)/ (r_a^2)`;</p>
        <h3>If Planet A Has Mass M, What Is The Mass Of Planet B?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Compare the two satellite&#039;s speeds. The mass of planet b compare to the mass of planet a? G a = g b.</p>
