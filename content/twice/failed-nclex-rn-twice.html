        <p>If you have failed your nclex you are required to have a waiting period of 45 days prior to being able to test again. I&#039;m sure if you passed nursing school, you have the capability of succeeding.</p>

        <p>The nclex is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. The exception is if your jurisdiction offers the nclex fewer times a year.</p>

        <h3>I Also Did Nurseachieve Cat Exams And Got Solid Pass On Both.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Either way, it’s okay that you failed. After each failure, she had to tell her nurse manager 3 times that she had failed. I used kaplan as a study tool only because it was paid for through my college tuition and we had been using it throughout.</p>
        <h3>Took The Nclex Last Week And Passed In 75!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You didn’t practice your critical thinking skills enough I recently took my second attempt in july and failed at 75 questions. Took my nclex for the first time the first week of feb 2020 and failed it with 265!</p>
        <h3>This Messes Up Plans For The Residency Program I Got Accepted Into And Is Extremely Frustrating.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you found the nclex too hard, it probably means one or both of two things: The nclex is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. I have a friend who i met when i was a new nurse graduate.</p>
        <h3>Take The Time To Understand Your Feelings And What You Are Going Through.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I had 32 sata, one exhibit, no hot spot, drag and drop or math. I graduated nursing school in 2017 and took nclex 2 months later. I have taken the exam twice and have my third exam scheduled for two weeks from now.</p>
        <h3>Example Of A Real Nurse Who Didn’t Pass Nclex First Try:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This time around, i used 4 resources to make sure that i was getting enough information as possible. For my second attempt i used simple nursing which i loved and did uworld again yet i still failed!??!?!!? Here is my journey of taking nclex twice so far.</p>
