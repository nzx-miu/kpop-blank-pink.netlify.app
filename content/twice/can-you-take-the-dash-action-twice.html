        <h3>Do You Think Taking The Attack Action Twice Means You Can&#039;t Attack More Than Taking It Once, Too?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So if you take the dash action, you can move up to twice your normal speed. When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect. Using dash twice in dnd 5e is possible when you have dashing available as a.</p>
        <h3>Feet On Your Turn If You Dash.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The extra attack of the barbarian allows it to attack twice when it takes the attack action. So according to the rules it says that on your turn you can move up to your speed and then take one action. You can command it to take the dash, disengage, dodge, or help action on its turn.</p>
        <h3>Dash When You Take The Dash Action, You Gain Extra Movement For The Current Turn.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There is no stipulation on dash that you can&#039;t use it as an action (if you have the ability to do so) if you&#039;ve taken it as your bonus action (like there is with casting a spell as a bonus action). Use my movement to move 30ft, 2. This is only available with specific character classes and in certain situations.</p>
        <h3>The Increase Equals Your Speed, After Applying Any Modifiers.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The dash diet includes foods that are rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium. Many abilities and spells (cunning action, expeditious retreat) allow you to dash as a bonus action. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount.</p>
        <h3>The Mobile Feat Can Only Be Taken Once And Is More Than Powerful Enough As Is.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, with haste you can dash three times, and at double speed. There is only one attack action for a pc or an npc, so. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers.</p>
