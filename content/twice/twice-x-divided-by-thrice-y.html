    <p>The sum of twice a number and 3. Then x/y is also a rational functions you are basically dividing two fractions which have both in. The sum of x and 7 divided by 2 ( x + 7 ) / 2:</p>
        <h3>Thrice X Plus Twice Y 8.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Six times a number increased by 15 7. 12.two times x increased by y. Two times x increased by y.</p>
        <h3>The Product Of 9 And M.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice thrice the product of a number and two a number multiplied by two two times a number twice a number thrice a number · 2x 3x division ÷ quotient of divided by the quotient of a number and two a number divided by two x 2 equal equal to result is is = examples: 23 was decreased by thrice of y is not equal to 15. Twice three less than a 12.</p>
        <h3>Eleven Times A Number X, Minus A Second Number Y.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Three less than y more than x 14. Seven tilñes the product of two numbers x and y, less five, divided by thrice a third number z. Five times the sum of a number and 3 10.</p>
        <h3>2X + Y (This Can Be Stated As :) Twice The Sum Of X And Y.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>11.twice the sum of x and y. The product of five x added to the product of two and y. Four more than the square of the sum of a and b 13.</p>
