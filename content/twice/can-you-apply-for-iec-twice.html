        <h3>Can I Apply For The Iec Program From Within Canada?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As a polish citizen, you may participate in iec twice. It says you can only apply once. This waiting period applies to citizens of the following countries:</p>
        <h3>In A Few Cases, You Can Only Apply For A Second Iec Work Permit After One Year Has Passed Since The Expiration Of Your First Iec Work Permit, But This Rule Only Applies To Applicants From Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia, And Spain.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you are a dual citizen you can apply for a working holiday visa with your other passport. Slovakian citizen must wait 3 months from expiration of their work permit to apply for a second participation under iec (for example, if the participant wants to pass from working holiday to young professional), whereas if the participant applies under ro status the requirement is. For instance, a citizen of both germany and ireland can get their first working holiday permit with her german passport and a second working holiday permit with her irish passport.</p>
        <h3>Yes, You Can Apply For The Iec From Within Canada.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Even if you hold a refugee travel document issued by a country that has a youth mobility agreement with canada, you’re not eligible to participate. From the day you accept the invitation, you’ll have 20 days to apply online for a work permit. To work in canada you need a work permit from ‘international experience canada’ (the iec) who are the immigration and citizenship department of the canadian government.</p>
        <h3>If You&#039;re Allowed To Participate A Second Time, You May Have To Wait A Specific Period Of Time Before Doing So.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It depends on the agreement between canada and your country of citizenship. If you want to visit, study or work in canada, make sure you’re eligible to apply. Even if you’re issued an invitation to apply, you can’t participate more times than your country allows.</p>
        <h3>As Long As You Didn’t Receive The Poe (Final Acceptance, Called A ‘Correspondence Letter’) Then You Can Apply Again.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, you can apply to restore your temporary resident status and extend your work permit. Go here for more information on how to apply. If you’re eligible, you may start working after you get an approval email.</p>
