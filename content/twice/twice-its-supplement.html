    <p><strong>Cool Twice Its Supplement Ideas</strong>. How do you find the measure of each angle? Let x be the measurement of the angle&#039;s supplement ⇒ x&#039; = 2x + 21 since the two angles are supplements x + x&#039; = 180</p>

        <p>Y = 2x + 93 Students should keep in mind that two supplementary angles take place by 180 degree. Let the angle be x the supplement=180 ∘−x according to the question x=2(180 ∘−x) 3x=360 ∘ x=120 ∘ hence the angle is 120 ∘ was this answer helpful?</p>

        <p>The supplement of a given angle is the angle which makes a sum of ${180^o}$, that is a linear angle, with the given angle. Find the measure of an angle, if six times it&#039;s complement is 12 degree less than twice it&#039;s supplement.</p>

        <h3>The Angle Which Is Twice Its Supplement Is:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Therefore multiplying the above value by 2 we get: So the answer isany angle, x degrees where 0 if the supplement of an angle os twenty more than. The angle that is twice that value is 60 degrees.</p>
        <h3>Medium Solution Verified By Toppr Solution:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum of twice an angle and half its supplement is 192^ {\circ}. One angle is 36° less than twice of the other angle. How do you find the measure of each angle?</p>
        <h3>The Supplement Of A Given Angle Is The Angle Which Makes A Sum Of ${180^O}$, That Is A Linear Angle, With The Given Angle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The measure of an angle is 21° more than twice its supplement. 2 x = 60 ∘ × 2 2 x = 120 ∘. If an angle is twice its complement you can represent the angle as x and other as 2x.</p>
        <h3>We Will Then Solve The Equation To Find The Value Of X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let the angle be x the supplement=180 ∘−x according to the question x=2(180 ∘−x) 3x=360 ∘ x=120 ∘ hence the angle is 120 ∘ was this answer helpful? So, 90∘ is the angle that is equal to its supplement. Let θ be the angle in question.</p>
        <h3>Likewise, Which Angle Is Equal To Its Supplement?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If one angle is 36° less than twice of the other angle, find the two angles. Let θ* be the supplement of θ. Likewise, people ask, what angle is equal to its complement?</p>
