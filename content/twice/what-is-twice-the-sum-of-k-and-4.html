    <p>Is defined by e(g(x)) = sum g(x k) p(x k). 20 + 20 + 12 + 2n = 70. The result is their sum or total.</p>
        <h3>Twice The Sum Of M And N.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>B decreased by twice a. The sum of roots = + = 3. Looking closely, we see a few keywords that would help us in translating this algebraic sentence into an equation.</p>

    <p>Find the present age of each. The sum means that you need to add the three numbers together. Work out the product of 2, 4 and 9.</p>
        <h3>This Value Is Equal To:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>4 x 5 + 5 x 4 + 4 x 3 + n x 2 = 2 x 35. The difference of triple a number and 5. Find k, if the sum of the slopes of the lines represented by x2 + kxy − 3y2 = 0 is twice their product.</p>
