        <p>Breathe it out, i can hear you now
you think reality&#039;s shut you down
and you&#039;re locked away where you can&#039;t get out
spent awhile on your back
but you know what it means to me, babe
in the course of a history, hey
it all makes sense to me somehow
and it&#039;s not what it used to. By helping ug you make the world better.</p>
