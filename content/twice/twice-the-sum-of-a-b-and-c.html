        <h3>If A Sum Of Money Is To Be Divided Among A, B, C Such That A&#039;s Share Is Equal To Twice B&#039;s Share And B&#039;s Share Is 4 Times C&#039;s Share, Then Their Shares Are In The Ratio:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If equal quantities of the alloys are melted to form a third alloy c, proportion of gold and copper in c will be (d) let x be the number that is 1 greater than b, then x = b + 1. Twice the sum of a and bis thrice of c 12.</p>
        <h3>Then The Quotient Of X And Y Is What We Want.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum = 5 + 8 = 13. Twice the sum of a and b is thrice c. The sum of the ages of a, b and c is 17.</p>
        <h3>A Quotient Of 2 And The Sum Of A Number And 3 ?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is (b + 1)/2b. The third integer is twice the second. So twice a number means 2x.</p>
        <h3>The Sum Of Twice A Number And 3.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The word ismeans equal to, so we set 2(a + b) equal to 3c: Then to get twice that you multiply the sum by 2. Then, the amount obtained by b = 3 × x.</p>
        <h3>The Sum Of A And B:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Answer provided by our tutors let a = the hours that volunteer a worked b = the hours that volunteer b worked c = the hours that volunteer c worked 144a + 119b + 139c = 788 a + b + c = 6 If the two numbers are 5 and 8. Thus the sum of a, b and c is therefore a + b + c.</p>
