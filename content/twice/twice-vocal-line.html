Lead vocal, lead dancer, center.</p>

        <h3>Before This, Twice Had 2 Successful Opening Concerts In Seoul, Korea, But Only With The Participation Of 8 Members.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hope you enjoy~ who is your top twice singer? Some say it&#039;s 3mix aka jihyo, jeongyeon and nayeon i&#039;ve seen others include sana and mina in the vocal line. But then again, three might be a bit small and there is always room for another one.</p>
        <h3>Izone Vocal *There Re Many F.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Who is part of twice&#039;s vocal line? Here‚Äôs my first vocal ranking, and it‚Äôs of girl group: Nayeon and v (bts&#039;s strongest vocalist, technically) might be about the same, some breath support is present in their voice, but not very strong/consistent.</p>
        <h3>Mina, Chaeyoung, Tzuyu, Sana, Dahyun And Especially Momo.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>And twice isn&#039;t known for their vocals but jihyo is a good singer (she was supposed to be the lead vocalist in 6mix) and nayeon/jeongyeon/mina are decent, tzuyu is becoming more stable which is a positive i think that out of the rapper line chaeyoung is a decent vocalist too i only refer to my biases by their first name or nickname. I wanted to do one with their first mini album release, but with page 2 out, i feel i have better sense of their vocal range. But when you compare nayeon and jeongyeon to jimin jin.</p>
        <h3>But There&#039;s Also Jihyo, Nayeon And.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Thanks for watching all rights reserved to ist entertainment anyway ~bye~#twice #linedistribution #howwould #apink #dilemma #nayeon #jeongyeon #sana #jihyo #. Consistent support upto the b4 although her bb4/b4s are often pushed. Jihyo‚Äôs higher range seems to have severely depleted over time, hence why.</p>
        <h3>She‚Äôs Extremely Tall, Standing At 5&#039;8,.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hoy les traigo todas la lineas en twice, para aquellos once que son nuev@s y no conocen las distribuciones de lineas en twice. She got the same chorus that jihyo, nayeon, and jungyeon got in like a fool. There are six of them.</p>
