        <h3>Two Pipes Can Fill A Tank In 10 Hrs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If q alone can complete a work in 12 days, p and q can finish the work in_____days. If p, q and r together work on a job, in what ratio should they share the earnings? P is twice as fast as q.</p>
        <h3>P Works Twice As Fast As Q.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Efficiency is directly proportional to earnings. R completes the race in 45 minutes. ⇒ efficiency of p = 2t also, q and r together can finish a work together in one third of the time in which q finishes the work alone.</p>
        <h3>P Works Twice As Fast As Q.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>P is 3 times more efficient than q. Together they can complete the work in $\dfrac{12×6}{12+6}=4$ days 6 rows ⇒ p works twice as fast as q.</p>
        <h3>P And Q Need 8 Days To Complete A Work.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So, r takes 6 days to complete the same work.hence, earning should be distributed in the ratio of their efficiency, i.e., 2 : P can do the work in 15 days, that is, p does 1/15 th of the work per day. If q can complete a work in 12 days independently the number of days in which p and q can together finish the work is। অপশন সমুহঃ 4 days, 6 days, 3 days, 5 days। সঠিক উত্তরঃ 4 days</p>
        <h3>Q Can Do The Same Job In 12 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let efficiency of q is 1 unit. 3) p, q and r are in a cycle race of 4500 meters. = 72 × 1 = 72.</p>
