        <h3>But, The Expression Can Also Be Written As 4 + 2X Since Addition Is A Commutative Operation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Write an algebraic expression for its length that is twice the width and is less than 3. Sum of the squares of x and y. 2(m + n) example 4 :</p>
        <h3>This Can Be Written As.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>X 2 + y 2. Write an algebraic expression using x to represent the test. Note that you will have to use parenthesis to enclose the entire expression twice a number plus one as follows:</p>
        <h3>So 9 + X Is An Algebraic Expression.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum of twice a number and 3. In this math video lesson on variable and verbal expressions, i write twice q as an algebraic expression. “a number increased by 10 is” translates to “n + 10 =”.</p>
        <h3>Thus “Twice A Number X” Can Be Written Symbolically As 2X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The expression 9 + 8 represents a single number (17). The expression 9 + x represents a value that can change. Twice a number decreased by [math processing error] 25.</p>
        <h3>Nine Less Than The Total Of Five Times A Number And Two:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can put this solution on your website! So twice a number means 2x. Thus, twice of x is simply, 2x.</p>
