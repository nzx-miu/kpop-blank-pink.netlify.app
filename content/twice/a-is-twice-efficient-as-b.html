A is thrice as efficient as b and b is twice as efficient as c if a, b and c work together how long will they take to complete a job which b completes in 10 days?"

        <p>Yes (3) | no (14) deepak gupta (9 years ago) since a=2b then, time taken to complete work by a and b is (1/2b+1/b)=1/7 then we get b=21/2. Solution (by examveda team) b takes 10 days to finish the job.</p>

        <p>If c and d can complete the work in 20 and 30 daysrespectively, working alone ,then in how many days a can complete the work individually: So, we get, the efficiency of a = 3 (efficiency of b) = 3 (2w) work/day = 6w work/day now, let us assume that a, b, and c work together for ‘n’ days.</p>

        <p>The efficiency of b = 2 (efficiency of c) = 2 (w) work / day = 2w work / day as we are given that a is thrice as efficient as b. If c and d can complete the work in 20 and 30 daysrespectively, working alone ,then in how many days a can complete the work individually:</p>

        <p>Ratio of no.of days 1/3 : A is twice efficient as b and together they do the same work in as much time as c and d together.</p>

        <h3>If The Ratio Of The Number Of Alone Working Days Of C To D Is 2:3 And If B Worked 16 Days More Than C Then No Of Days Which A Worked Alone?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>He can complete that work with in 81/2 days. Therefore, together they will finish the job in. Therefore a&#039;s one day work=2/81.</p>
        <h3>A And B Work Together For 8 Days And Thereafter, A Is Replaced By C.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>1526 students attemted this question. Yes (3) | no (14) deepak gupta (9 years ago) since a=2b then, time taken to complete work by a and b is (1/2b+1/b)=1/7 then we get b=21/2. Which implies a will take 10/3 days to finish the same job as a is thrice as efficient as b.</p>
        <h3>A Is Twice Efficient Than B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The ratio of efficiencies of a, b and c = 2 : The efficiency of b = 2 (efficiency of c) = 2 (w) work / day = 2w work / day as we are given that a is thrice as efficient as b. (1/b) = 3 (1/c) if n is the number of days required for all three working together, n [ (1/a) + (1/b)+ (1/c) ] =1.</p>
        <h3>Efficiency Of C = 3 × 1 = 3.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If c and d can complete the work in 20 and 30 daysrespectively, working alone ,then in how many days a can complete the work individually: Now since it is given in the question that a is twice more efficient than b, so we can say that a takes half of the time that b. A is twice efficient as b and together they do the same work in as much time as c and d together.</p>
        <h3>S, T And U Can Complete A Work In 40, 48 And 60 Days Respectively.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A + b = c + d. If a,b,c work on alternate days with a starting firs, in how many days will the job finished ? If a, b and c work together, a piece of work will be completed in 12 days.</p>
