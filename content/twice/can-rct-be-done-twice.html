        <p>However, we recommend that patients stretch on their own the other days when they do not see the therapist. Not many chances of saving that tooth if it’s been done twice already.</p>

        <p>An additional endodontic treatment, called a retreatment (a second root canal procedure), can be performed, which could again, allow a patient to keep his or her tooth for a lifetime. No, the gp is to find out which tooth the fistula is coming from.</p>

        <p>For example, if an rct failed because one of the root canals in a molar tooth was not identified and cleaned then a second attempt which filled all the canals might be more successful. It may not heal or respond to treatment, as expected for many different reasons:</p>

        <h3>The Root Canal Treated Tooth Is Cracked:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Breakage of file in the root canal. Again a cone beam ct scan should be able see it. If your tooth failed to heal or develops new problems, you have a second chance.</p>
        <h3>Whether It Is Required To Perform The Rct Or Go For Tooth Removal Due To Infection Depends On How Long The Affected Tooth Is Going To Stay In The Child&#039;s Mouth.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As the living tissue of the tooth is removed during root canal treatment, the remaining tooth is dry and brittle. It&#039;s not that invasive of a procedure and your endodontist should be able to handle it fine. While not always noticeable, swollen tissues typically are tender to touch.</p>
        <h3>Based On Your Symptoms, I Would Advice You Go In For A “Retreatment Rct”, I.e.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It may not heal or respond to treatment, as expected for many different reasons: Root canal treatment is like any other medical or dental procedure. In some cases they are (a) not feasible or practical, (b) considered unethical, and (c) not free of limitations.</p>
        <h3>Untreated Or Missed Root Canals.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Other reason for recurrent infections of previously root canal treated tooth could be there is a fracture somewhere in the root, if that&#039;s the case the tooth is done. The question is whether or not that makes sense as a treatment. Even the most skilled dentists can perform root canal treatment that fails.</p>
        <h3>This Is More Likely If The Root Canal Treated Tooth Was Not.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Over extension of gp point into peri apical region. On other occasions, a tooth initially responds to the treatment, but begins to hurt again some months or even years later. No, the gp is to find out which tooth the fistula is coming from.</p>
