        <p>In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement :return returnvalue is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called. Please help i have been struggling for some time now. Select value from dropdown and submit form in jquery.</p>

        <p>This is why your click events are being handled twice. The ajax method is called before the page gets loaded.</p>

        <p>So i think the ajax is only being fired once, but the route is being called twice. At first i thought it was this jquery ajax function that was causing it to be called a second time:</p>

        <p>It sets ajaxloading back to false so if the link is clicked again the content will be loaded again. 9 years ago your document.ready function is being loaded each time your ajax query submits.</p>

        <h3>If You Run This In Firefox And Turn Off The Server, The Alert Box Will First Say 1, Then 2.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You should then define something that you want to do after the first click on the checkbox through functiontodisplaycheckboxaspending (box), including the disabling of it so you cannot click it twice (you can remove the click action too). The actual route is only called once. The callback function on lines 8 to 10 is passed as the second parameter and is called once the ajax request has completed.</p>
        <h3>Select2 Ajax Calls ,Sorting,Filtering Data Server Side In Jquery.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Any questions on the above code would also be gladly answered. Before insert statement php code performs select query to find duplicate records and continue to insert statement. At first i thought it was this jquery ajax function that was causing it to be called a second time:</p>
        <h3>In Fiddler This Is What I See:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As of jquery version 1.8, this method should only be attached to document. The desired result gets printed twice, and then sudden;y low and behold another time my servlet gets called, that too the doget () method. I wish to send a token in the header of ajax request.</p>
        <h3>My Servlet Gets Called Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is why your click events are being handled twice. This is proven by resetting testcount when the function is called, but incrementing it in success. I have a simple form:</p>
        <h3>I Added A Print Statement In The Function Bound To The Route Being Called Twice, And It Turns Out The Somehow That Function Is Being Called Twice By Flask, While The Get Listings Still Appear The Same In The Log.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So i think the ajax is only being fired once, but the route is being called twice. The ajax call replaces the div (which has the button) so it appears the button is getting wired up multiple times, once for each ajax call. The ajaxsuccess () method specifies a function to be run when an ajax request is successfully completed.</p>
