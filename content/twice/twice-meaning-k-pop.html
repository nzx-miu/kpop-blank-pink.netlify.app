        <h3>A Male Calls An Older Male “Hyung” And An Older Female “Noona.”.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I mean i get the meaning of it but you yourselves acknowledged them by giving these haters a name and now they have a purpose not as individuals but as a group and that was a mistake. The title track song, tt, was about a girl that feel sad because she can’t let go her feeling to the boy she loves even though the boy was mean to her. Finally, it’s time for a little bit of math.</p>

    <p>It seem it was inspired from the emoticon tt that has been used worldwide to express that ‘i’m like crying’. Here was the reff part from the song. I was stupid for not knowing.</p>
        <h3>In The Interview, The Female Stars Conveyed The Meaning.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice, is as you mentioned, the kpop group. But if they have for example: Jihyo, nayeon, jeongyeon, momo, sana, mina, dahyun, chaeyoung, and tzuyu.</p>
        <h3>They Sinned In The Garden Of Eden.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The 2 represents twice, while the 9 represents the number of members. This fandom name is a cheeky one: This time, twice are referring to their feelings, so although this line literally translates you ‘you don’t know my heart like this, you’re so mean’ it actually means ‘you don’t know how i feel, you’re so mean’ why not try making your own sentences in the comments?</p>
        <h3>Thrice Are The Total Opposite Of Once.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For a female, she would call an older male “oppa” and an older female “unni.”. The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, jeongyeon, momo, sana, jihyo, mina, dahyun, chaeyoung, and tzuyu.</p>
