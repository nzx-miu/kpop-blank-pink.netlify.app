        <h3>For Acute Bacterial Sinusitis, Azithromycin Way Be Taken Once Daily For Three Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Pneumonia takes up to 8 weeks to resolve. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. I&#039;m on day 6 of chest congestion and coughing.</p>
        <h3>Do Not Take More Of It, Do Not Take It More Often, And Do Not Take It For A Longer Time Than Your Doctor Ordered.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But now i have a light itch and slight discomfort, i’m on my period and it hurts a lot when i insert and take out a tampon. Does zithromax raise blood pressure? Azithromycin is used to treat certain bacterial infections in many different parts of the body.</p>
        <h3>Sometimes The Thick Mucus Is Not Bacterial Or Causes Blockage Of The Lungs And Requires More Aggressive Treatment.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>He prescribed two zpacks, said to take the first, wait a week and then start the second. My symptoms include coughing and a slight h. 14 erythromycin reduced aecopd in relative terms by 35% and increased the median time to first exacerbation from 89 to 271.</p>
        <h3>Even Thought They Told Me It Was Safe I Still Feel Weird Taking It But I Really Do Need, I Am Miserable.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The total cumulative dose is 1,500 mg in 5 days. Respiratory infections can run a protracted course in some. For children, the dosing is typically based on their weight and what condition is being treated.</p>
        <h3>This Is Common Practice And Probably What The Drug Vendor Told Them Was How To Prescribe It.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This medicine may mask or delay the symptoms of syphilis. I took tylenol twice during this whole period because i was desperate, but the guilt was killing me:(( i finally called the doctor and he is prescribing z pack antibiotic for 7 days.
