        <p>Because hfs uses 4k blocks to store data and zfs uses 8k blocks, if every file in the file system were 4k or less, z/os v1r13 zfs could require up to twice as much dasd space. Ixsystems has adopted the newer codebase, now called openzfs, into its codebase for truenas core. Invoked automatically as part of the boot process.</p>

        <p>If every file in the file system is 1k or less, z/os v1r13 r13 could require up to four times the dasd storage as was needed in previous releases. The reason i&#039;d prefer /mnt over /root is because you&#039;re most likely working on a readonly filesystem (boot cd?).</p>

        <p>They say, zfs does not need fsck because the data on disk is always correct. I&#039;ve solved with setting mountpoint to legacy and putting the conflicting mounts in order in /etc/vfstab, but wondering if there is a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
