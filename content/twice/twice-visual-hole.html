        <p>I used to think that chaeyoung was the visual hole for twice as i find her short hair really ugly. Rap monster has always joked around that all of his members were flower boys, excluding him. But is jihyo really considered ugly?1.</p>

        <p>Personally, i think rap monster would laugh if he read that he brought the group&#039;s visuals down. I respect everyone&#039;s opinions on this as long as you can respect mine.</p>

        <p>I used to think that chaeyoung was the visual hole for twice as i find her short hair really ugly. Could you possibly use a darker color to outline the actual playing surfaces to help distinguish between those and the ones that are in the background?</p>

        <h3>At The End Of Last Year, A Youtuber Revealed The Truth Behind Jeongyeon‚Äôs Sudden Weight Gain And.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Rap monster has always joked around that all of his members were flower boys, excluding him. Dahyun without makeup is the cutest thing i&#039;ve seen. Personally, i think rap monster would laugh if he read that he brought the group&#039;s visuals down.</p>
        <h3>But Is Jihyo Really Considered Ugly?1.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This list is pretty unbiased. A different version of this was made in the past. Although the jyp entertainment group is known as a group full of visuals, netizens were deeply impressed at their impressive visuals even at a.</p>
        <h3>This Is My Official Twice Visual Ranking.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Many idols from top groups like blackpink, twice, bts, stray kids, and more were featured in. Jeongy e on unfortunately had to be absent from this schedule due to health reasons. I used to think that chaeyoung was the visual hole for twice as i find her short hair really ugly.</p>
        <h3>I Respect Everyone&#039;s Opinions On This As Long As You Can Respect Mine.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Eye (i) before e except after see (c) reveal answer? Yuqi is a chinese idol based in south korea. Dubu ranking low doesn&#039;t mean anything against her, she&#039;s gorgeous but compared to the other members, many do consider her the visual hole. i&#039;ve never actually seen her get hate or criticism for her face tho</p>
        <h3>I Find Her Smile To Be Childish.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Netizens often criticize idols for looking less than perfect in past photos, but were shocked to discover how beautiful the members of twice looked in recently rediscovered photos. I don‚Äôt have the best vision, and on this course the background branches look extremely similar to the actual branches. Like chanmi, people only call her &#039;the visual hole of twice&#039; because of her body.</p>
