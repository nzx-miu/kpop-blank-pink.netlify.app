        <h3>Jack Has 10 Apples And Peter Has Half As Many As Jack. So Peter Has 5 Apples.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>My salary is twice as high as yours. This piece of information means that x = 2 ( y + z) hence we have the system of equations. The exponential function of 1 is always equal to the base:</p>
        <h3>‘As Much As’ Indicates A Ratio;</h3>

    <p>Similarly, 120 is twice as many as 60. The first factory receives twice as much as other two factories combined. He has twice as many fives as tens.</p>

    <p>C) as much + uncountables = as much rain as. (1) x + y + z = 12 (2) x = 2 ( y + z) substituting (2) into (1) we get that. It would mean that class x has double the students as that of class y.</p>
