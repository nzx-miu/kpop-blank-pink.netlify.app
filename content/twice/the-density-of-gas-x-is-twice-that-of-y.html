        <p>Under the identical conditions of temperature, the density of a gas x is two times to that of gas y while molecular mass of gas y is three times that of x. The density of gases have been listed below in alphabetical order in the units of both metric and imperial. The density of a gas &#039;x&#039; is twice that of another gas &#039;y&#039;.</p>

Under the identical conditions of temperature, the density of a gas x is two times to that of gas y while molecular mass of gas y is three times that of x.</p>
        <h3>What Is The Molecular Weight Of Gas Y?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We know, pm = drt so, p x m x = dx rt. The rate of effusion of unknown gas x is found to be about 1.5 times that of sf6 gas (mw=146 g/mol) at the same conditions of temperature and pressure. Diffusion is that property by virtue of which a perfume bottle when opened up in a room, makes the whole room fragrant with its smell.</p>
