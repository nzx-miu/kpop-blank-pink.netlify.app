    <p><strong>Cool Twice Ult 2022</strong>. The best is during his ult. For me, my ult bias happens to be from twice which is jihyo (praise the god) and she&#039;s recently become my ult bias because i notice her presence in variety shows being such a strong leader to a fast rising girl group.</p>
