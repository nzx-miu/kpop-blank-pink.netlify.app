        <h3>The Difference Of 25 And N:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>X more than y 12. Five times a number n added to six. Write the phrase as an expression.</p>
        <h3>The Measure Of Z Is 10¬∞ Less Than Twice The Measure Of Y.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The area of a rectangle equals the length times the width. 3 less than the sum of w and t. The difference between z and y is 20¬∞ to find:</p>
        <h3>Product Of 4 And Z Is The Same As 16.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So it really depends on what that something is, but the basic idea is that the. Twice the difference between 6 times h and 3 gives 30. The difference of the product of x and y and z 9.</p>
        <h3>The Difference Of Twice A Number And 3:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>20 more than, the product of 5 and the sum of r and s: Twice the difference of p and q: The word is tells us the equal sign goes between 9 and 15.</p>
        <h3>The Sum Of 6 6 And 9 9 Is 15 15.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We have to make an algebraic expression ,when twice of x is subtracted from z. 10 3 x 5 2.8 3 (y 2 z) the equation is 10 x 5 2.8(y 2 z). The average of y and z is greater than y by 2.</p>
