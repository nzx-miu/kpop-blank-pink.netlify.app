        <p>Progress events are expensive (change detection runs on each event) and so they should only be requested if the consumer intends to monitor them. If i call the same api from any rest client then it calls one time only, that means no.</p>

    <p>I can confirm that by reading the backend logs. The id from the response is assigned to the local postid property in the subscribe callback function. Once loaded we the make a second request a fetch the homeworld of that particular character.</p>

    <p>The clone() method&#039;s hash argument lets you mutate specific properties of the request while copying the others. If server responds within 5 second, it&#039;s fine but if it takes more time, server gets another hit from angular.
