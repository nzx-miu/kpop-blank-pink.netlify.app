        <p>I also took plan b twice in one month and what ended up happening was that i started spotting for a little over a week and it really really scared me!!

When you take a morning after pill so close to your period’s ending, you have a higher probability of experiencing what we call withdrawal bleed (which, on a side note, is not an actual period).</p>
