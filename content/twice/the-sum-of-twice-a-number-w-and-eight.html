        <h3>Which Equation Represents &amp;Quot;The Sum Of Eight Times A Number And Seven Is Twice The Number&amp;Quot;?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Click here to see the step by step solution of the equation. Cubed the cube of a number; Answer by checkley77(12844) ( show source ):</p>
        <h3>2(25 + 8)Or You Could Just Write 66.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The correct answer will be d. The difference of triple a number and 5. 32 = 2a + 8:</p>
        <h3>Sum Represents The Addition Operation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>2x +4 −4 = 14− 4. The quotient of fifty and five more than a number is ten. How do you write the equation for the sum of 14 and a number is 8 times the number?</p>
        <h3>The Word Sum Means Add And Should Always Be Used With The Word And To Indicate Which Numbers Are Being Added,.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum of a number and 6 is 8 more than twice the number. The sum of 8 and a number is written as 8 + x. Twice the sum of a number and 8 is 24.</p>
        <h3>(Think About Ittwice The Number 8 Would Be 2 8 = 16.) The Word Sum Indicates That You Should Add 6 And 2 X Together To Get A Final Answer Of 6 + 2 X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Note that it is important to double and add the correct values. The phrase twice a number translates into two times the number, or 2 x. A number cubed x3 equals ( = ) equals seven less than a number equals ten.</p>
