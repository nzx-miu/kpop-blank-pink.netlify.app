        <h3>For Adults, The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (Ul) — The Highest Daily Intake Likely To Pose No Risks — Is 2,000 Mg Per Day.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Introduction in 1956, denham harman, founder of age, proposed the free radical (ros) theory of aging [1]. The daily value for vitamin c was raised to 90 mg for men in 2000, and upper limit of 2,000 mg per day was established as being safe. You’ll have beautiful skin in no time.</p>

        <h3>However, At Doses Above 1 G/Day, Absorption Falls To Less Than 50% And Absorbed, Unmetabolized Ascorbic Acid Is Excreted In The Urine [ 4 ].</h3>
    <br/>
