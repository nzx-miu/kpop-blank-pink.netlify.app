        <p>The radius is 3in use 3.14 to approximate pi and round to the nearest hundreth if 4vir4ik [10] Twice a number means that number multiplied by #2#, so twice a number #t# translates as #2t# so, the fraction is #\frac{2t}{12}#, which can be simplified into #\frac{t. Correct answer to the question write in algebraic expression!</p>

    <br/>
    <p>The quotient of t times 12. Double a number 2x multiplied by a number multiplied by negative six −6x of three fourths of a number 3 x 4 division ( ÷ ) the quotient of the quotient of a number and seven x 7 divided by ten divided by a number 10 x the ratio of the ratio of a number to fifteen x 15 powers ( xn) the square of; You might be interested in what is the approximate volume of the sphere?</p>
        <h3>Twice A Number Means That Number Multiplied By 2 , So Twice A Number T Translates As 2T.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>1.the number when divided by five has a quotient in whole number , and 2.no remainder if left after the division. R + 45 = 79 x / 7 = 13 twice = double = 2 times a number = multiply by 2 Since 2 divided by five results in the quotient as 0.4 (which is not a whole number), we say that 2 is not divisible by five.</p>
