        <p>Skin care is a pretty big deal, and we love subs like /r/skincareaddiction, however we felt there needed to be a sub that deals specifically with skin that&#039;s over 30. You can use gentle moisturizer for the hydration of the skin.</p>

        <p>As it can increase sensitivity to the sun, particularly the possibility of sunburn; As always, i advise you to do a patch test first as the product contains a high concentration of acids.</p>

        <h3>How To Apply The Peel.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How much does the ordinary peeling solution cost? ﻿this product is not eligible for discount My skin is pretty resilient though and its not sensitive but has acne/texture so depends on your tolerance.</p>
        <h3>The Ordinary Recommends No More Than Twice A Week.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Beta hydroxyl acids (bha) also exfoliate the skin with an extended function to help clear pore congestion. For weekly use, i prefer a smaller concentration of acids used more frequently. As it can increase sensitivity to the sun, particularly the possibility of sunburn;</p>
        <h3>This Combined 32% Aha/Bha Solution Offers Deeper Exfoliation To Help Fight Visible Blemishes And For Improved Skin Radiance.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Alpha hydroxyl acids (aha) exfoliates the skin’s topmost layer for a brighter more even appearance, while beta hydroxyl acids (bha) exfoliates the skin more deeply to clear pore congestion. To see if this product is a fit for you, below is our detailed review on this fan favorite product. You can purchase the ordinary aha 30% + bha 2% peeling solution at sephora, ulta, or on the ordinary’s website.</p>
        <h3>Do Not Leave On For Longer Than 10 Minutes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Personally, i think this is too much. The ordinary recommends performing a patch. It must not be left on for more than 10 minutes and is not recommended to be used more than twice a week.</p>
        <h3>Rinse Thoroughly With Lukewarm Water.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How &amp; when do i use the ordinary aha 30%. Use once or twice a week at most. We recommend applying it at night.</p>
