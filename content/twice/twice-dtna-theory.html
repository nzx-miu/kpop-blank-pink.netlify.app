        <p>My guess based on what i&#039;ve seen so far (assuming the idea of cain and abel are used) would be that dahyun would be cain and sana would be abel. Theory and explained for bdz mv by twice based on their music video, lyrics, dance, and reaction.</p>

        <h3>Jihyo Is The Only One Wearing White And It Can Be A Symbol Of An Angel.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dunno how true it is, and i hope it‚Äôs not because i‚Äôd hate to have seen the other girls that didn‚Äôt make it be put through something like that. Twice once let‚Äôs go üò≠ #kpop #. I have the same reaction.</p>
        <h3>Theory And Explained For Dance The Night Away Mv By Twice Based On Their Music Video, Lyrics, Dance, And Reaction.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice live performances of dtna can be tak. Itzy and twice are fine bc the groups have hits in the past like dtna and dalla dalla. Chaeyoung being eve (as in my theory she was the first to join jeongyeon), jihyo being adam (having been convinced by jeongyeon later), which leaves 2, cain and abel.</p>
        <h3>Diambil Dari Beberapa Situs And Ofcourse My Opinion.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jihyo is actually the only one who is still alive which is. Theory and explained for dance the night away mv by twice based on their music video, lyrics, dance, and reaction. However, comments of a sexual nature will be removed, as well as those that are overly argumentative, aggressive or generally rude.</p>
        <h3>Part 2 Of The Twice Are Ghosts Theory.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Reply to @donutshopman video is by kpop junkee #. I have a theory that jyp purposely putting polarizing debut song to making nonfans talking about nmixx since they saw that nmixx couldn&#039;t gather hype as much as jypggs before. Dtna being a mv about the girls getting into a shipwreck and their locked on the island.</p>
        <h3>Twice Live Performances Can Be Taken Into Consideration For.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Tiktok video from j (@luv3chae): If i&#039;m right we should see jihyo, jeongyeon, and (fake?) chaeyoung together in the teasers the same way they were in m&amp;m and maybe them returning to the dtna cave. Hanya berisi teori2 mv kpop.</p>
