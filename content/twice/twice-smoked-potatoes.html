        <h3>Bake The Spuds Until Tender, About 1 Hour.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Slowly add the hot milk and melted butter. Add wood chips according to manufacturer&#039;s instructions. Step 3 place the potato directly on the smoker rack and cook for 3 hours.</p>
        <h3>Cut Potatoes In Half And Scoop Out The Insides Into A Bowl;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These are called smoked twice baked potatoes because you bake them in the smoker (or any heat source for that matter), cut them in half, scoop out the insides and mix it with my original rub ( purchase formula here | purchase bottled rub ), bacon, cream cheese, jalapeños, etc., and grated cheese on top, then put it back into the potato skins and bake them even more. Today&#039;s recipe is for twice smoked baked potatoes cooked on the pit boss pellet grill. Add enough wood for 1 hour of smoking as specified by the manufacturer.</p>
        <h3>Directions Preheat The Oven To 350 Degrees F.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Brush oil over entire potato. Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees f. Use a fork to gently “smash” potatoes, making sure to still keep them intact.</p>
        <h3>And Let Them Cool For A Few Minutes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Scoop out the flesh of the potatoes, being sure to keep skins intact. Fill the potato skins with the potato filling. Pinch cayenne pepper (optional) 1 small bunch scallions;</p>
        <h3>Remove The Potatoes And Cut Them In Half Lengthwise.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>With an electric hand mixer, whip the potatoes on low speed for about 30 seconds. Put in smoker at 240 for 3 hours; Cook for 2 to 3 hours until soft.</p>
