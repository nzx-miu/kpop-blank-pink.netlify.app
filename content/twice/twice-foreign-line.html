        <p>There&#039;s something about each of them that attracts people to twice. She would have found out that she was pregnant after weeks of mood swings, eating way more than she already does, craving things she never thought she liked, and she knew something was wrong when she didn’t even feel like getting up to dance.</p>

        <p>She would try to teach you as much as she could and would laugh whenever you said something wrong. I think out of all the idols who have no korean blood in them and was never raised in korea, nichkhun and pinky/kyulkyung are the only two who have a close to native level of understanding the language and pronunciation.</p>

        <h3>Creator Of The Shyshyshy Effect In S.korea.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes or yes 5 november 2018 6th ep 1. I think the thing that is most shocking about twice&#039;s foreign line popularity is the fact they are japanese and chinese. For sana and tzuyu to be as loved as they are in korea despite korean.</p>
        <h3>Sana And Momo Didn&#039;t Look As Pretty As Now.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Like the top comment says, sana would be the closest but none of them sounds like a native still. Twice wjsn fx jyp sm kamitruth miss a by kamitruth, january 21, 2016 in celebrity photos &amp; videos 230 members have voted 1. She would be so happy that you wanted to learn japanese just for her.</p>
        <h3>This Is Just For Funthank You For Watching :)</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Mina maybe a bit less but recently she&#039;s gotten so many stans. There are two groups that came to mind one is bp if we consider both rose/ lisa as foreign line and another one is asepa that both ningning and giselle are foreigners they may not popular as twice foreign line now but it possible in future. She would go to the doctor and.</p>
        <h3>Twice&#039;s Momo, Sana, Mina And Tzuyu Mispronouncing Korean Words, Lagging Behind A Little And Using The Foreigner Card.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I think out of all the idols who have no korean blood in them and was never raised in korea, nichkhun and pinky/kyulkyung are the only two who have a close to native level of understanding the language and pronunciation. Who&#039;s the best foreign line? When you told her that you wanted to learn her native language she would have the biggest smile on her face and tell you that you came to the right place.she would teach.</p>
        <h3>As Everyone Know Twice Has 4 Foreign Members.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>She would try to teach you as much as she could and would laugh whenever you said something wrong. Sana and momo are also popular. There&#039;s something about each of them that attracts people to twice.</p>
