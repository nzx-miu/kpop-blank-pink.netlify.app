        <p>If you don&#039;t get sedated from it, then don&#039;t worry about taking it during the day. It is unlikely that taking two 10mg tablets will cause any serious side effects.</p>

        <p>If you gave two to three times the recommended dose i wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Experiencing major side effects from taking two tablets of zyrtec (20mg total) would be very.</p>
