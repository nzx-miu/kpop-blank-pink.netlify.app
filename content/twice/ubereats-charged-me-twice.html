    <br/>
    <p>They cannot accommodate an allergy or special request. They charged my account twice for one food order from. Charged twice after tipping but couldn&#039;t pay the 2nd charge.</p>
        <h3>From Time To Time, Uber Will Seem To Charge You Twice Or Even Thrice The Same Amount For What Appears To Be The Same Ride.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However at this time such a call may be frutile, though you can keep trying. In fact i recommend all uber customers to check their weekly/monthly/daily statements. This does not mean you were charged twice.</p>
        <h3>Get Contactless Delivery For Restaurant Takeout, Groceries, And More!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I placed an order to pay cash because the app was not deducting the cost from my credit for some reason. Ubereats has charged me twice for one order. Restaurants may notify you if they run out of an item or can’t accommodate allergies or special requests.</p>

        <h3>The Most Common Answer Is To Telephone Paypal Support.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I immidiately tried to contact ubereats but only could contact via email. At the start of a trip, uber may place a temporary authorization hold for the upfront price of the trip on your payment method. It is a disappointing response from ubereats but not wholly out of character for them.</p>
