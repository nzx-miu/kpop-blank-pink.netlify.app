        <h3>The Molecular Mass Of Gas B Is Thrice That Of A.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Molecular mass of a is half of molecular mass of b. The partial pressure ratio of a and b is 4:1. Let density of gas b be d.</p>
        <h3>The Two Gases Are At The Same Temperature.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The ratio of the pressure acting on. D = d a d b = 2. In the question, it is given that d b = 20.</p>
        <h3>And The Molecular Weight Of A Be M.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The molecular mass of gas `b` is thrice that of `a`. This can be written mathematically as: The molecular mass of b is thrice that of a.</p>
        <h3>The Ratio Of The Pressures Acting On A And B Will Be ?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The ratio of pressure of gas a and gas b will be : âˆ´ density of gas a = 3d and let molecular weight of a be m. Since, r is gas constant and t is same for both gases, so.</p>
        <h3>(10 Pts) This Problem Has Been Solved!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The density of a gas a is twice that of b. Asked jun 24, 2019 in chemistry by piya (79.5k points) the density of gas a is twice that of b at the same temperature the molecular weight of gas b is thrice that of a. The molecular mass of gas a is half as that of b.</p>
