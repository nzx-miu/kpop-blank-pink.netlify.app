        <p>I thought it was implantation bleeding and that i was pregnant, i never knew plan b could cause spotting since it doesn&#039;t list it as a possible side effect on the tab, which it should b/c i can imagine a lot of people getting freaked out by this. Plan b can be taken as many times as necessary to prevent an unplanned pregnancy if taken regularly. It only takes one cell, from each of you, so volume means very little.</p>

        <p>It is possible to take plan b as many times as necessary to prevent an unplanned pregnancy. First of all, it&#039;s not a form of birth control, and it never should be used as such.</p>

        <p>Plan b can be used safely in a limited number of ways. Plan b can be very effective at preventing pregnancy if you take it within 72 hours of unprotected relationship, and preferably even sooner.</p>

        <h3>Please Try To Find Alternative Forms Of Birth Control Than Repetitively Taking Plan B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I also took plan b twice in one month and what ended up happening was that i started spotting for a little over a week and it really really scared me!! It only takes one cell, from each of you, so volume means very little. What happens if you take plan b 2 times in a month?</p>
        <h3>Moreover, As You Told There Was No Ejaculation The Chances Of Pregnancy Decreases To Nil.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Plan b can delay both ovulation &amp; your next period. Typically, it is only necessary to take one dose of plan b each time a person has sex without contraception. The sooner you take it, the better it works.</p>
        <h3>It&#039;s Called Emergency Contraception For A Reason.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It has been a week since you had your first sexual encounter and about 4 to 5 days for the last one. While you can take plan b multiple times , it is meant to be emergency contraception and not a replacement for birth control. Taking a morning after pill twice in one week is possible, but you might be exposing yourself to risks.</p>
        <h3>However, Condoms Are The Only Method To Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases Such As Hiv, Hep B, Chlamydia Or Gonnorrhea.or Hpv</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But you shouldn’t take plan b pills if you’ve taken ella since your last period. Does plan b work after 6 days? The morning after pill (commonly referred to as plan b) is an over the counter form of emergency contraceptive.</p>
        <h3>Please Try To Find Alternative Forms Of Birth Control Than Repetitively Taking Plan B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, you can take it again. Id say get on some kind of birth control, because you can&#039;t keep taking plan b, its not meant for that. As the first dose will have likely already affected things, the second dose will knock your cycle right out of shape, so it is difficult to know when you will next ovulate or have a period.</p>
