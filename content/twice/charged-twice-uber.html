        <p>Charged twice you might get charged twice during busy periods or simply by accident. This is because when you first placed the order, we put a temporary charge, which acts as a hold, with your payment method.</p>

        <h3>A Few Weeks Ago I Flew Back Home From A Business Trip, Downloaded The App And Got An Uber From The Airport To My House.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have an issue with uber too. Just like any commercial enterprise, uber uses a system that enables them to charge their. This also includes trips that are later canceled.</p>
        <h3>All They Need Is To Steal $10 From Each Rider In A Month.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Charged for a ride you didn’t take I’ve never even been to london and luckily my credit card company didn’t let the charge go through. They charged me twice, and they charged me again instead of refund me, i made an order with 30$ ( 25$ voucher 5$ from my credit card ) and then it was a missing items in my order , and instead of they refund me , they charged me 10.90$ in the next day for nothing !!!</p>
        <h3>I Immidiately Tried To Contact Ubereats But Only Could Contact Via Email.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the fare for your travel is modified for whatever reason, you will receive an updated receipt. All authorisation holds are voided within a few business days, depending on your bank&#039;s policy. But the money has already went through, and i can&#039;t afford another order charge so it declined, i read up about authorisation charges.</p>
        <h3>11, 2021, During Her Shift As An Uber Driver, According.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Uber charged me twice 1. What looks like an extra or duplicate charge on a trip is likely an authorization hold. Gethuman5582556 did not yet indicate what uber should do to make this right.</p>
        <h3>We Are Waiting For Gethuman5582556 To Fix The Problem And Share The Solution With The Rest Of Us Customers.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I contacted uber support, changed my password, and got it resolved and thought. Since you can only take a ride once, this type of charge will be a simple one to dispute. I don&#039;t even know what uber c.</p>
