        <h3>Twice A Increased By The Cube Of A Equals B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Because we are multiplying 5 5 times the sum, we need parentheses around the sum of m m and n n. Average age of p ,q and r is 10 years. P is two years older than q who is twice as old as r.</p>
        <h3>To Take A Sum, We Look For The Words Of And And To See What Is Being Added.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>R&#039;s age given is 5 years. P&#039;s age is twice the average age of p, q and r ie 2x. Average of their ages = p+q+r/3 = s/3.</p>
        <h3>P Is The Same As Q P = Q Multiplication By 2 Two, Two Times, Twice, Twice As Much As,.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>X x 2 yz 5. There are two operation words: So triple a number means 3y.</p>
        <h3>How Do You Write A Math Expression For This Phrase:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Four times the sum of f and g is identical to six times g. Translate the following mathematical sentences into algebraic expression 1.the sum of the reciprocals of a,b and c 2.the square of the sum of p and q 3.twice the sum of a and b divided by the square of c 4.the product of a,b and the square of c subtracted from twice the product of a cube 5.the product of 15 and x subtracted from thrice y Now the mother is only twice as old as her son.</p>
        <h3>Total Age Of P, Q And R Will Be 10 * 3 = 30 Years.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let say first term = a. Sum of x and twice y. Does twice the sum of 16 and a number mean 2*16 + x or does it mean 2*(16 + x)</p>
