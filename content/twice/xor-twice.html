        <p>Xor of all array elements gives us the number with a single occurrence. Add two numbers without using arithmetic operators; We have n + 2 elements in array with 2 repeated elements (say repeated elements are x and y) and we know the range of elements are from 1 to n.</p>

        <p>All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. The inner xor is the encryption and the outer xor is the decryption, i.e., the exact same xor function can be used for both encryption and decryption.</p>

        <p>The idea is based on the following two facts. Xor all the elements of the array into a variable sum thus all the elements present twice in an array will get removed as for example, 4 = “100” and if 4 xor 4 =&gt; “100” xor “100” thus answer will be “000”.</p>

        <p>As we know a xor a = 0. Then we will subtract the sum of the whole array from the twice_sum and get the required number (which appears once in the array).</p>

        <p>The propagation delay of an xor gate is twice that of an and/or gate. Since we now have xor of num1 and num2, how can we find these two single numbers?.</p>

        <p>It seems the double xor is only displayed once when the emulation fails, but only in the first loop (it is not visible on my code since it fails on the first one). Add two numbers without using arithmetic operators;</p>

        <p>With this logic, a string of text can be encrypted by. 12 = 00001100 (in binary) 25 = 00011001 (in binary) bit operation of 12 and 25 00001100.</p>

        <h3>Xor All The Elements Of The Array Into A Variable Sum Thus All The Elements Present Twice In An Array Will Get Removed As For Example, 4 = “100” And If 4 Xor 4 =&gt; “100” Xor “100” Thus Answer Will Be “000”.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Find the number in o(n) time &amp; constant extra space. A) xor of a number with itself is 0. Remember that in binary 1 stands for true and 0 stands for false.</p>
        <h3>Note That The Duplicate Elements Will Be Xor Ed Three Times In Total, Whereas All Other Elements Will Be Xor Ed Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since we now have xor of num1 and num2, how can we find these two single numbers?. The propagation delay of an and/or gate is 1.2 microseconds. 12 = 00001100 (in binary) 25 = 00011001 (in binary) bit operation of 12 and 25 00001100.</p>
        <h3>A B A Xor B 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 Xor Is A Symmetric.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The inner xor is the encryption and the outer xor is the decryption, i.e., the exact same xor function can be used for both encryption and decryption. It seems the double xor is only displayed once when the emulation fails, but only in the first loop (it is not visible on my code since it fails on the first one). Xor is a digital logic gate that outputs true or 1 only when the two binary bit inputs to it are unequal i.e for an input of 0 &amp; 1 or 1 &amp; 0.</p>
        <h3>And All Elements Occur Once Except Two Numbers Which Occur Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We are left with xor of x and y, x ^ y, where x and y are two duplicate elements. Xor of all array elements gives us the number with a single occurrence. If we do xor of all elements of the given array, we will be left with xor of num1 and num2 as all other numbers will cancel each other because all of them appeared twice.</p>
        <h3>If We Xor All Of This, We Essentially Remove All Values That Appear Twice, Thanks To The Xor Trick.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Arr = [4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1] n = 5 output: Find the element that appears once in an array where every other element appears twice; This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>
