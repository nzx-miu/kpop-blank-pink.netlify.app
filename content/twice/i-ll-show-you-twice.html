        <p>She told about it, i thought &#039;i&#039;ll show you&#039; would be this traditionally happy song, but as i sat in my room, staring at the window, the first words poured out. Sights so nice, i’ll show you twice… posted by andrew dressel february 13, 2022 posted in uncategorized from my breakfast table, it looks like a much nicer morning than forecast, but i’m going to hold off on visiting the park until after my 11am presentation so that i can give both my full attention.</p>
