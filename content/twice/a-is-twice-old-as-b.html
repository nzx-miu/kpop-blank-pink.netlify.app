        <h3>Five Years Ago A Was 3 Times As Old As B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Ages of a and b after “x” years are 34+x and 4+x respectively. Also given that the ages of f and s is differing by 40 years. You can put this solution on your website!</p>
        <h3>On Saturday At The Jack In The Box Near Mountain Highway East And 204Th Street East.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>$ hence, a is twice as old as b after 26 years. Let the age of c be ‘x’ then according to question, age of b will be twice of age of c, so, b’s age will be 2x and it is also given that a is 2 years older than b so, age of a is (2 + 2x) years. A is seven years older than b who is twice as old as c.</p>
        <h3>Answered 2 Years Ago · Author Has 10.6K Answers And 8.7M Answer Views.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So, according to the first statement, that is a is twice as old as b. So, the correct answer is “ 26 years”. In four years&#039; time, a will be 31.</p>
        <h3>B Is Twice As Old As A But Twice Younger Than F.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The present ages of a and b are 34 and 4 respectively. In four years&#039; time, a will be 31. We can say that, age of a = 2 × (age of b) age of a = 2 x.….</p>
        <h3>Thus , Age Of A.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The present age of f = z. C is half the age of a but is twice older than d. Hence, b&#039;s age = 2x = 10 years.</p>
