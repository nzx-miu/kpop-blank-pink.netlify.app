        <p>If you&#039;re using angularjs and your jquery click event is inside the controller, it will get disturbed by the angular&#039;s framework itself and fire twice. I put in some logic that checks some values to prevent the event emitter ( this.framechange.emit(frame)) from firing twice since this makes an api call in the parent component.</p>

        <p>Keeping buttons in a pressed state prevent an event from firing twice when a user double clicks on a button split buttons prevent an event from firing twice when a user double clicks on a button description buttons are frequently tied to a javascript action, such as an ajax callback, that fires when a user clicks on the button. The focus and blur events are not defined to bubble by the w3c, so as a convenience we translate them to focusin and focusout.</p>
