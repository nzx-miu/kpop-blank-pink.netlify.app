        <h3>In Conclusion, The Correct Option Is D.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The quotient of w and 10 is equal to 7 w/10 =7 18. The quotient of m and 2 is expressed as \large{{m \over 2}} the product of 4 and n is expressed as 4n; The difference between m and n is 16.</p>
        <h3>The Square Of The Sum Of X And Y.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We can rewrite all of those words as ( 2 * x ) * 2. Using the given variables, translate the following to mathematical expressions. The other number being multiplied is 2.</p>
        <h3>When You See Twice That Means 2 *.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum of m and n. Therefore, the product of mn is 71.9556. The score increased by 8 points s + 8 16.</p>
        <h3>Twice A Number The Product Of 2 And N 2 Multiplied By A Number 2 Times A Number 2N The Quotient Of Z And 3 A Number Divided By 3 The Ratio Of Z And 3 Translate Each Verbal Phrase Into An Algebraic Expression Or Equation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Is equal to twice the m t h term. Sum = 16.4 m product = 115.2 m3 largest = 8 m smallest = 2.4 m. Let&#039;s put all that together.</p>
        <h3>The Correct Answer Was Given:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sum of m and n = m + n. The square of the difference between two numbers is equal to the difference obtained when twice the product of the two numbers is subtracted from the sum of their squares. The algebraic identity to find the square of difference between two numbers is as follows:</p>
