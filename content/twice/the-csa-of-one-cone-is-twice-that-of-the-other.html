        <h3>Let Us See The Steps That He Should Be Going Through.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>S = √ (r 2 + h 2) lateral surface area of a cone: Hemispherical dome of stupa needs to be painted. Π r1 l1 / π r2 l2 ⇒ π r l1 / π r l2 ⇒ l1 / l2 = 4/3.</p>
        <h3>A Cylinder Has 2 Circular Ends And A Curved Surface.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Determine the curved surface area of a cone whose base radius is 7 cm and slant height is 15 cm. Pls mark me as brainliest and follow me Hence, the ratio of the csa of two cones is 4:3.</p>
        <h3>Find The Ratio Of Their Radii.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This placement is based upon the substance’s medical use, potential for abuse, and safety or dependence liability. Find the ratio of their radii. Let’s assume it’s equal to 14 cm.</p>
        <h3>How To Find The Circumference Of A Circle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since, csa of a cone = πrl, therefore. Curved surface area (csa) = πrl. Devarsha wants to make a toy by putting together a hemisphere and a cone.</p>
        <h3>Now, Curved Surface Area Of Sphere = 4 Π R 2.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let slant height of the first cone = ℓ. Let the radius of each solid be r and since the height of the sphere is equivalent to diameter, let the height be 2r. Let curved surface area off 1st cone 2x csa of 2nd cone = x and slant height of 1st cone = h and slant height of 2nd cone = 2h 2.</p>
