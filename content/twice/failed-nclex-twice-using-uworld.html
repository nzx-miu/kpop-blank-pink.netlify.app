        <p>I didn’t think it would be beneficial to do it by category as nclex is all random q’s anyway. Registerednursern, saunders and nursing illustrated text book 106q&#039;s. I had 36 sata, 4 drag and drop and 1 math q.</p>

        <h3>I Didn’t Think It Would Be Beneficial To Do It By Category As Nclex Is All Random Q’s Anyway.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hurst qreview has good prioritization questions similar to nclex. I don’t know what to do!!!!! I averaged 62% on uworld.</p>
        <h3>Once You Graduate You Are Required To Take Your State Boards Exam For Whatever State You Currently Reside In.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I passed my nclex at 105 with 33 sata. On july 16, 2019 i took my nclex for the first time and failed! My first assessment on uword told me i had a high chance of passing that was one month before my exam and my 2nd assessment was 2 days before my exam and it said very high chance of passing.</p>
        <h3>Uworld Test Prep Offers Test Preparation, Practice Tests And Assessments For More Than 1 Million Users Who Are Preparing For Usmle, Abim, Abfm, Nclex, Mcat, Sat, And Act Examinations.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I’ve used uworld and ati but now i’m looking for something else to help. You name it, i am feeling it. I thought i felt prepared, but the qs i received i thought i answered to the best of my knowledge.</p>
        <h3>I Then Bought Uworld Again And Found Out About Mark K Lectures And Listened To All Of Them Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hello, so i graduated in december 2018 with my rn bsn. I used uworld my first attempt and failed in 78. Uworld and saunders text book 75q&#039;s.</p>
        <h3>On February 3Rd At 2Pm.i Took My Exam In Dallas, Tx.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I scheduled to take boards february 3rd 2018. I understand most of the content, and if i don&#039;t i go over it everyday until i can. I, unfortunately, have failed my nclex pn twice and am feeling extremely discouraged, depressed, angry, hopeless, worthless.</p>
