        <p>You can bleach your hair twice, but not twice in a row on the same day as it may cause hair breakage and hair fall. And when i say damaging it doesn&#039;t dry your hair out as much.</p>

        <p>Moreover, if you want to become blonde, you will most likely have to apply bleach onto your tresses two times! To avoid significant damage, it’s crucial to give your tresses enough time for recovery, so wait for at least three days before another session.</p>

        <h3>However, My Hair Is Virtually Impervious To Chemicals, And Grows Like Rapunzel, So I Had Nothing To Lose.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>My hair hardly grows anymore because i dyed it too much within days. It could cause permanent damage and result in extreme hair breakage and dryness. Either way its still bad.</p>
        <h3>In Addition, Do Not Bleach Your Hair Again The Next Day.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Thinner hair or hair that’s constantly being straightened/heated is going to suffer way worse. Just not in one day. Because lighting your hair takes moisture out.</p>
        <h3>Your Hair Will Be Able To With Stand The Dying Process As Long As You Take Care Of It.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Bleached hair does not get oily as easily as unbleached hair. You should be fully aware of what bleaching does to your hair: Bleaching is an aggressive (and at the same time) delicate process for your hair.</p>
        <h3>So How Long Should You Wait Before Bleaching Your Hair The Second Time Around?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you like to be adventurous with your hair color, then it’s safe to bleach your hair twice a year. You can do a bleach bath again a few days later if it does not lighten as much as you like but the more you do it, the more vulnerable your hair becomes. But, keep in mind that the more time the bleach sits on your hair, the more shedding you may experience.</p>
        <h3>I’d Be Lying If I.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Left that conditioner in all night while i slept. Even one bleaching is harmful enough, let alone two! There should be at least 3 weeks between bleaching.</p>
