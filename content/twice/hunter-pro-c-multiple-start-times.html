    <p>This mode is an ideal option for arranging your irrigation zones into groups such as lawns or gardens. I looked behind the screen to see if there were any loose connections, but do not see any. Each program has the ability to water up to four start times per day.</p>
        <h3>For The Valves To Stay Open In One Zone, While Shutting Outlets In Other Zones, There Needs To Be A Minimum Amount Of Water Pushed Through The Valve.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The example below will be the most common which is time based. Add a schedule name and choose a watering type. Learn how to set multiple start times on your hunter irrigation controller with roger from all wet irrigation &amp; lighting!</p>
        <h3>If You&#039;re Trying To Set Two Different Times For Two Different Valves In A, That&#039;s Your Problem There.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>About a month ago, i noticed that zone 1 no longer turns on, but zone 2, 3, and 4 do. Only one start time should be set for each active program. It&#039;s probably like other products.</p>
        <h3>If You Set Zone 1 For 10 Minutes And Zone 2 For 10 Minutes, And Set Start Time 1 For 10Am And Start Time 2 For 6Am, Both Zones Will Run Consecutively At Both Of Those Times.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For instance, our 4,000 series require 10 gallons per minute (gpm) to operate and our 6,000 series require 15 gpm. Press the button to set this day as a no water day. Only one start time per active program is required, a second start time will cycle the program an additional time.</p>
        <h3>To Add A Program Start Time, Navigate To The Zones &amp; Schedules Page In Your Hydrawise Account And Click On Add Watering Time.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It is a good practice to use multiple start times based on variable such as sprinkler type, soil type, and slope, as well as root zone depth. Use the button until the cursor is at the day of the week you wish to set as a no water day. This is ideal for various types of plants that have separate watering day requirements.</p>
