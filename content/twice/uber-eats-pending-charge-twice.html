        <p>From time to time, uber will seem to charge you twice or even thrice the same amount for what appears to be the same ride. A delivery fee, a service fee, and a small order fee.</p>

        <p>Probably cause the support doesn&#039;t know enough english to understand your problem. Try contacting paypal support using social media such as facebook or twitter as this works more often than telephoning.</p>

        <p>From time to time, uber will seem to charge you twice or even thrice the same amount for what appears to be the same ride. Sometime they asked me to consult with my bank, sometime they said that i didn&#039;t pay amount for previous order.</p>

        <p>Your uber account or payment account may occasionally show 2 or more identical charges for the same amount. One says uber eats, the other days uber pending.</p>

        <h3>They Replied With, &#039;An Authorization Hold Is A Pending Charge Placed On Your Account While We Confirm Your Payment Method&#039; And That It Would Be Resolved Within A Few Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If this happens, we recommend confirming that you haven&#039;t taken separate trips that happened to have the same fare. If it is a credit card, uber does receive payment and the deduction shows on your credit card bill. They told me different cases at different conversion.</p>
        <h3>If You Believe You Have Duplicate Charges, Please Check That There Is No Corresponding Trip Or Fare Adjustment.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The customer is actually charged before the service or a reserve is placed on the card. Once logged in, look up your ride under your trips, select the ride that you wish to dispute, then click i would like a refund and then select the reason for the refund request. If your order was canceled, the temporary authorization hold should reverse within a few business days.</p>
        <h3>I Immidiately Tried To Contact Ubereats But Only Could Contact Via Email.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the trip has been canceled or the total. Please check with your family and friends. Uber eats have taken payment from my bank twice, one says uber eats, the other days uber pending.</p>
        <h3>When You Check The Charge, You&#039;ll See The Hold Stays In Pending Status, Until It Disappears From Your Account.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Review your trip history and check if the trips you made match the charges. This does not mean you were charged twice. Instead of a booking fee for.</p>
        <h3>Unrecognised Charges Can Often Be Tied Back To A Friend, Coworker, Or Family Member Who May Be Using Your Payment Information Or A Linked Account.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Just call your bank and dispute it tell you got double charged. Although they are not actually charged to you, authorisation holds may show. I filed a complaint with my credit card company but it’s still pending.</p>
