        <h3>The Correct Choice Describes The Nature Of Body Waves And Surface Waves.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These arrive after p waves. Body waves pass through earth&#039;s interior, whereas surface waves travel at the earth&#039;s surface. Body waves pass through earth&#039;s interior, whereas surface waves travel at the earth&#039;s surface.</p>
        <h3>For A Wave Pulse On A String To Travel Twice As Fast, The String Tension Must Be Quickcheck 16.2 A.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Decreased to one half its initial value. • a surface wave is a wave that propagates in two. P, s, l, and r are all body waves that pass through the earth&#039;s interior.</p>
        <h3>It Is After Studying The Trajectory Of S Waves Through The Layers Of Earth, Scientists Were Able To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The correct answer is d faults that have not yet pierced the earth’s surface cannot be visually identified or mapped by geologists, and can only be detected by drilling or geophysical studies. Whereas if the rock into which they pass is less dense, their velocity will decrease. They travel through the earth in curved paths, but they change.</p>
        <h3>L And R Are Surface Waves (Not Body Waves);</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>D) water leakage from reservoirs cannot trigger quakes. C) governments are supportive of the worldwide seismic network because it can detect nuclear bomb tests as well as natural earthquakes. These waves travel in a linear direction.</p>
        <h3>The Movement Of Particles Is In The Direction Of.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The hypocenter (focus) is the point on the earth&#039;s surface directly above the epicenter. Governments support the worldwide seismic. If the rock into which they pass is more dense, their velocity will increase;</p>
