        <p>There is still a great need for action in the area of energy efficiency. If a, b and c work together, a piece of work will be completed in 12 days. They can complete whole work in = 1/ 1/25+1/50+1/100.</p>

        <p>C will take 7 days (as c is twice efficient than b) let total work be = lcm of 21, 14, 7 = 42 units and let a worked for x days alone. Since a is thrice as efficient as b , a takes one third the time that b takes to finish the work meaning a= b/3 or b = 3a.</p>

        <p>If c and d can complete the work in 20 and 30 daysrespectively, working alone ,then in how many days a can complete the work individually: Let the times taken by a , b and c individually to finish the task be a , b , and c days respectively.</p>

        <h3>There Is Still A Great Need For Action In The Area Of Energy Efficiency.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Efficiency of kiran = 5% efficiency of karan = 4% they will complete only 90% of the work = [(5+4)*10] =90 remaining work done by suman = 10%. If they work in pairs (i.e., bc, ab, ca) starting with bc on the first day, ab on the second day and ac on the third day and so on, then. A takes 6 days less than c, when a and c completes the work individually.</p>
        <h3>∴ 1/X + 1/3X = 1/60 ⇒ X = 80.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let the times taken by a , b and c individually to finish the task be a , b , and c days respectively. C=number of days taken by c , then efficiency of c = 1/c. A is twice as efficient as c.</p>
        <h3>If Chitra And David Can Complete The Work In 20 And 30.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A and b work together for 8 days and thereafter, a is replaced by c. Efficiency of a = 6. Since a is thrice as efficient as b , a takes one third the time that b takes to finish the work meaning a= b/3 or b = 3a.</p>
        <h3>Efficiency Of A = 2 × 1 = 2.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In what time can b complete the work? B takes thrice as many days as c. Atq, ⇒ 2x + 9 × 2 = 42.</p>
        <h3>X And Y Together Can Do A Piece Of Work In 30 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>C is twice efficient than b. A) a does twice as much work as done by b in equal time i.e. A can do a piece of work in 21days.</p>
