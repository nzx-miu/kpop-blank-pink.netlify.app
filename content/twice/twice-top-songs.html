        <p>This song is one of twice’s older songs, when their choreography was not as difficult and catered towards more simple, easy, and catchy moves that fans can easily learn. All twice songs in release order, includes japanese releases while including instrumentals. “i can’t stop me” this song is one of twice’s most famous songs, but the entire song is very catchy and upbeat.</p>
