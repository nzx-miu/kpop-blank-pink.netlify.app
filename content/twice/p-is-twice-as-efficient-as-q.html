    <p><strong>The Best P Is Twice As Efficient As Q 2022</strong>. Let work be 60 60 unit. Then q can complete $1$ unit a day, p can complete $2$ unit a day (because p is twice as fast as q).</p>

        <p>If p and q work together, how much time will it take to complete the same work? P is thrice as good a workman as q and therefore able to finish a job in 48 days less than q. Let efficiency of q is 1 unit efficiency of p = 2 unit total work = 1 × 12 = 12 days</p>

        <h3>How Much Time Will Pipe A Alone Take To Fill The Tank?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>( \large p:q \) efficiency \( \large 3 : 60−28 =32 60 − 28 = 32 unit of work is remaining. P is 30% more efficient than q.</p>
        <h3>If P And Q Work Together, How Much Time Will It Take To Complete The Same Work?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Q can do the work in 20 days, that is, q does 3/60 th of the work per day. Shyam can complete a task in 12 days by working 10 hours a day. P can complete a work in 23 days.</p>
        <h3>From , We Can See That Q And R Are Equal Efficient And P Is 3 Times More Efficient Than Q Or R.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hence, q can alone do the work in 9 days. P is 3 times more efficient than q. 6) a takes twice as much time as b or thrice as much time as c to finish a piece of work;</p>
        <h3>For How Many Days Did They Work Together?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hence, p completes in 10 days and q in 30 days. Find the time in which they can finish the job together. And p can do a work in 24 days.</p>
        <h3>If Difference Of Time Is 48 Days, Q Takes = ( 3 2 × 48) = 72 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>One day work of p and q is ( 3 + 1) = 4 units. Three times of p and two times of q are multiplied = 3p × 2q =3p2q. P is thrice as good a workman as q and therefore able to finish a job in 48 days less than q.</p>
