        <h3>Use Opks Every Day From Day 10 Until Your Positive Lh Surge.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Why is my ovulation test positive for 5 days in a row? For this reason, first morning urine may not give the best result. The first is the gradual lh surge pattern, which occurs over the course of a few days;</p>
        <h3>Remember The Kit Detects An Lh Surge Not Actual Ovulation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you have ‚Äúmissed‚Äù the hormone surge during past cycles, then we advise testing twice a day. If your lh drops quickly (normal, not a problem) by noon the next day it may already be gone. The first lg surge is indication of upcoming ovulation.</p>
        <h3>Can You Miss Lh Surge Testing Twice A Day?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you‚Äôre trying to conceive, we also recommend testing twice a day when you‚Äôre in your fertile window to maximize your chances of catching your surge. And lh is a hormone that helps your reproductive system, according to webmd. How often should you test for the lh surge?</p>
        <h3>This Only Means That No Lh Surge Has Been Detected At The Time You Tested, So It Is Encouraged To Keep Testing.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If your lh surge is rapid onset, test twice a day. Gov / 17434509 updated august 24, 2020 All other surges throughout your cycle are normal.</p>
        <h3>Sometimes, The Peak Time Of Luteinizing Hormone Is Short And Lasts Only A Couple Of Hours.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>After completing your 1st cycle using premom, you can start testing 5 days earlier than the premom predicted ovulation day. If your test line keeps same dark or darker than control line over 2 days, you have gradual onset. For the most accurate result, health care providers suggest testing twice a day, 10 hours or more apart, for a few days prior to ovulation.</p>
