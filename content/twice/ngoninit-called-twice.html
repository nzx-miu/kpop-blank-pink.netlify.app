        <p>Why it is called twice right now, if an error happens during detecting changes of content/view children of a component, ngoninit will be called twice (seen in dynamicchangedetector). I&#039;m finding this weird because when i&#039;m testing the application &#039;on it&#039;s own&#039;, i.e. It detects simple changes in the property values.</p>

        <p>Class constructor initiates settimeout twice. The ngondestroy or ondestroy hook is called just before the component/directive instance is destroyed by angular.</p>

        <p>One answer referenced a template compilation error, and scrolling through the remaining answers one also references the fact that if a button is present in your template without an explicit type=button it may be treated as a submit button by your browser and therefore cause the app to execute the code multiple times. Angular2 routing issue and ngoninit called twice.</p>

        <p>Why is ngonchanges called before ngoninit? This hook can be interpreted as an “extension” of ngonchanges.you can use this method to detect changes that angular can’t or won’t detect.</p>

        <h3>Ngdocheck Marks The Display For An Update.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I looked why ngoninit called twice?, difference between constructor and ngoninit, angular 2 app component ngoninit called twice when using iframe, ngoninit called everytime i change route. This happens only when reloading. This can lead to follow up errors that hide the original error.</p>
        <h3>Whilst Testing I&#039;ve Noticed That When I Load The Application The App Component Ngoninit() Function Is Being Called Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This can lead to follow up errors that hide the original error. The ngondestroy or ondestroy hook is called just before the component/directive instance is destroyed by angular. And this method is called angular when the component is rendered.</p>
        <h3>Was Finally Able To Resolve The Issue After Getting The Debugging Help From @User3249448.</h3>
    <br/>

    <p>It detects simple changes in the property values. This information comes from this github issue That means someone has to invoke it, whereas constructor is automatically called by javascript engine.</p>
        <h3>Class Constructor Initiates Settimeout Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This hook is costly since it is called with enormous frequency; The ngoninit () hooks only once after all directives are instantiated. Right now, if an error happens during detecting changes of content/view children of a component, ngoninit will be called twice (seen in dynamicchangedetector).</p>
