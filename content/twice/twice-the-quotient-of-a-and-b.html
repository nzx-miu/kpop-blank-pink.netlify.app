        <h3>This 18 Words Question Was Answered By John B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>What is twice the quotient of 50 and the sum of a number y and 8? 2t + 8 = 33: The solution is x x 4 1 2 3 2 + = there are equivalent solutions like this one:</p>

    <br/>
    <p>First we look at the this underlined part: The sum of a number y and 8 means add y and 8, so that&#039;s y+8, so we put it in parentheses, (y+8), and replace those underlined words by (y+8): I have tried a few ways but webworks.</p>
