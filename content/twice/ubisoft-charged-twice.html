        <p>Charging the full amount is inexcusable but it goes even beyond that. Attempted to subscribe through the app, it failed and said something happened, don&#039;t worry you won&#039;t be charged.</p>

        <p>Not sure why a company this size is unable to provide basic functional software. Ubi digs into their own pockets and refunds all double charges immediately until they can figure out how to improve the transaction process.</p>

        <p>Charging the full amount is inexcusable but it goes even beyond that. The reason it may appear that you have been charged twice could be an authorisation hold by your bank, whilst the payment attempts to go through.</p>

        <h3>This Is Not Okay And Is Ilegal.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Chat with a ubisoft agent or send us a message. If anyone got any help, please tell reply. Dear ubisoft sir or madam, i recently purchased a game from the ubisoft store (anno 1800 complete 3 year edition).</p>
        <h3>Last Game I Bought On Uplay Was In February 2019.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Years later, they still have the same issue. I tried it a few times but i always got the same message that says order failed. and i have enough money on my card. Said to hell with it.</p>

        <h3>Usually, Once The Payment Is Successful, The Payment For The Subscription Will Be Taken And The Authorisation Hold For The Same Amount Will Return To Your Bank Within 7 Working Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Ubisoft has advised affected subscribers to submit a ticket to its support team, and has provided a stickied forum post with problems and solutions. Without any acknowledgment or confirming on my part. I do not have any proof of purchase just the messages i received on my number from the bank regarding the amount.</p>
        <h3>Attempted To Subscribe Through The App, It Failed And Said Something Happened, Don&#039;t Worry You Won&#039;t Be Charged.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I was charged on my credit card but have not recieved the game and have not recieved any confirmation of my purchase. Log in to your ubisoft+ account to activate your games, see rewards, and read the latest game news. I payed for uplay* last night ***** and ubisoft double charged my bank account.</p>
