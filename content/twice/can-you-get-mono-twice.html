    <p>So, if you’ve already had mono once, and you think you’re getting it again, it’s more likely that you actually have another illness with similar symptoms, such as strep throat or influenza. Most of the time, people who come down with the disease known as infectious mononucleosis, also known as mono, only get it the one time. Can a person get mono more than once?</p>
        <h3>Acquisition Of This 2Nd Or 3Rd Germs Could Give You A Similar Illness.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Most people get infected with ebv at some point in their lives. If the symptoms of mono remains there 6 months after initial diagnosis, we call it chronic active mono. I thought that once you got mono you couldn&#039;t get it again.</p>
        <h3>They Have Developed Antibodies And Become Immune.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Is it possible?most people will only get mono once, but the infection can make a comeback in rare cases. While the ebv will be in your body the rest of your life, you won’t get mono again. Yes mono can recur.once you are infected the virus remains dormant in the body and in most of the people it can lie there inactive, in few people it can reactivate and can cause symptoms.</p>
        <h3>You Should See An Infectious Disease Specialist For.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, you can get mono twice, but that&#039;s a very rare occurrence. So, if you&#039;ve already had mono once, and you think you&#039;re getting it again, it&#039;s more likely that you actually have another illness with similar symptoms, such as strep throat or influenza. But rarely, mononucleosis symptoms may recur months or even years later.</p>
        <h3>However, There Are Other Germs That Can Cause A Mono Like Illness.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Unless you were monospot positive twice you probably got one of each. Mono symptoms usually begin four to six weeks after you’ve been infected with ebv. Must be some sort of virus.</p>
