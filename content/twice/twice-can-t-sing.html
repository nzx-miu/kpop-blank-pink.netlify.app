        <p>How is it possible for every song they release. It‚Äôs a pretty popular opinion to think that momo is not a good singer but 100% of the time i see people excusing it and blaming the fact that jyp songs are too high for her.</p>

        <p>I remember commenting on twice&#039;s vocals saying that they don&#039;t deserve the fame and success. Twice 9 ‚Ä¢momo‚Ä¢ i&#039;m not saying that momo is a bad singer.</p>

        <p>Due to copyright, there are no audios at 7:36 and 7:47, here are. I also compared their vocals to other big kpop girl groups like blackpink and red velvet and said that they&#039;re the worst.</p>

        <h3>I&#039;m Disappointed In Twice&#039;s Live Vocals In I Cant Stop Me.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Momo can‚Äôt sing not bc jyp songs are ‚Äútoo high for her‚Äù. Twice 9 ‚Ä¢momo‚Ä¢ i&#039;m not saying that momo is a bad singer. Twice cant sing live 98.7m views discover short videos related to twice cant sing live on tiktok.</p>
        <h3>But Then, After Cheer Up Era I Realised That Twice Improved A Lot, It Took Me A While To Realise That Twice Have Talents.</h3>

    <p>| the main vocal cant even singüòí #twicegoats #twicecantsing #twiceflops #twicelipsync | just like nayeon, hit the high note correctly bruhüò§ | you even trained for 10 years and you cant even sing correctly As the song topped the charts immediately, winning them an undisputed first place against baekhyun, txt and monsta x. Like if you like the video.</p>

        <h3>Twice Goatsüò± (@Idontliketwice92015) Has Created A Short Video On Tiktok With Music Silence.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In my personal oponion twice have members like nayeon, jihyo and jeongyeon who can sing wery well but other members have practice. If any other groups tries to sing songs that are as radical, unconventional and weird as twice, they&#039;ll flop into oblivion. Jihyo‚Äôs encore vocals sound stable but different because in twice‚Äôs songs she‚Äôs clearly not singing in her comfortable range, showing her voice is also not being utilised properly either.</p>
        <h3>It‚Äôs A Pretty Popular Opinion To Think That Momo Is Not A Good Singer But 100% Of The Time I See People Excusing It And Blaming The Fact That Jyp Songs Are Too High For Her.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Subscribe my second youtube channel: Listen, i know the girls have proved themselves many times over the years, and i and many others have given them the benefit of the doubt. Netizens have commented that i can&#039;t stop me seems to be too high even for nayeon, who is singing the majority of the song, as she struggles to.</p>
