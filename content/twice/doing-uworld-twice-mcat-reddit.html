        <h3>Is Aamc Easier Than Uworld?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have already gone through the altius prep course last year and now just reviewing my notes and starting to do uworld and fill in the content gaps that way. Spend your time on doing as many unique questions as possible. I did phase 1 (9 weeks) while still taking classes, then phase 2 (6 weeks) during our dedicated study time.</p>
        <h3>The Average Scores On The Biochem Tests Are Generally Lower (Around 60% Vs 80% In Bio), So I&#039;d Say Go With Biochem Mostly, But Sprinkle In Some Bio (Maybe Choose Some Sections You Are Lest Good At Or The Most Complex).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>My experience so n=1 but i did 2 passes through uworld and scored 246 on step 1. Biochem is also pretty nitpicky on interpretation of experimental methods and results, which. Usually the averages are in the low 60s.</p>
        <h3>If You Want To Know How Well You&#039;ll Do On The Actual Mcat, Take All Of The Official Aamc Practice Fls.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It puts you through usmlerx once and uworld twice in two phases of at least 9 and 6 weeks. Check out the sidebar for useful resources &amp; intro guides. The first element of your plan should be content.</p>
        <h3>By Alec Palmerton, Md In Plan.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The second element of your plan should be uworld. Any medical student can tell you that this advice is as ubiquitous as it is overwhelming. I did a few hundred of the incorrects during those 2 weeks then reset at the beginning of dedicated.</p>
        <h3>Are You Taking It 2 Days After, 2 Weeks After Or 2 Months After Year 2 Ends.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Of course everyone has their own opinions. With thousands of questions to grind through before test day, many students have a hard time imagining how they’ll make it through a single pass of the uworld question bank. I failed the regulation section twice while using wiley cpa.</p>
