        <h3>Punineep And 9 More Users Found This Answer Helpful.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The number is unknown, so it is represented using a symbol, such as x. The difference between 5 times the first number and the second number is 31. .4 write each of the following as an equation, then solve.</p>
        <h3>You Can Put This Solution On Your Website!</h3>
    <br/>

        <h3>This Shows That The Number Is At The Most 3 Digits Long;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>( z / 7 ) + 5 : Sum of a 2 and 3 is 2 + 3, sum of 1 and 2 is 1 + 2, and so on. The difference of triple a number and 5.</p>
        <h3>Two The Sum Of The Number And X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Double a number 2x multiplied by a number multiplied by negative six −6x of three fourths of a number 3 x 4 division ( ÷ ) the quotient of the quotient of a number. The sum of twice the first number, 3 times the second number, and 4 times the third number is 46. Even with 3 digits, 4 times the sum must exceed 100 =&gt; the sum must exceed 25 =&gt;the number must b.</p>
        <h3>So The Answer Would Be 5+2X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The product of the product of fourteen and a number 14x twice; The difference of twice a number and 3: Thus, the sum of a number, which is x, and 4 is:</p>
