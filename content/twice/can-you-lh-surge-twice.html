        <p>Easy to read and clear line help to pick up the most fertile time without guess. If you have “missed” the hormone surge during past cycles, then we advise testing twice a day.</p>

        <p>As a result, some health care providers suggest doing the test twice a day — a few days before ovulation and at least 10 hours apart — to pick up the lh surge. The number of days since the last menstrual period.</p>

        <p>It’s best not to wait until the next day to do another test, or you could miss detecting your fertile days. According to reproductive facts, the lh hormone will ‘surge’ in women and then 36 to 40 hours later, an egg will be released.</p>

        <h3>Lh Levels In The Urine.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Yes, it&#039;s possible to ovulate twice but this usually happens at about the same time of the cycle. It may have come earlier than expected. Most women have a surge in lh in the morning, and those levels can be picked up in your urine about four hours later.</p>
        <h3>If You Have A Short Or Irregular Cycle, Make Sure You Begin Testing Early Enough.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you have collected a sample to test, then you can use this same sample straight away to do your second test. Well one thing is the opk is only showing the surge in lh (a hormone that encourages the egg to come out to meet the sperm). It’s best not to wait until the next day to do another test, or you could miss detecting your fertile days.</p>
        <h3>So A Positive Opk Doesn’t Actually Prove You Ovulated, It Just Means The Hormone Spiked Which Should Cause Ovulation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You could even test twice a day — once between 11 a.m. And again between 5 p.m. The test kit consists of several test sticks to be used once a day until you detect your lh surge.</p>
        <h3>You Can&#039;t Ov At 2 Different Times.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you don’t detect your lh surge with this second test, then test again tomorrow at the usual time. “i counsel women to have intercourse starting a couple of days before the anticipated lh surge and then once or. You simply pee on a test strip (like a pregnancy test) and when the test line is darker than the control line, your lh is high and it’s time to try to make babies.</p>
        <h3>But Whether You Test Once Or Twice, Aim To Do It At The Same Time (Or Times) Each Day.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sometimes, testing twice a day can resolve this issue. Two lh surges do not mean you ovulate twice (and sustained lh levels don’t mean you ovulate for longer) now, we know we said earlier that an lh surge indicates that ovulation is likely coming up soon, so it may be tempting to think that two lh peaks means you ovulate twice, or that a sustained high level of lh means you’re ovulating for longer. Levels of lh as low as 25 miu/ml can be detected within 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
