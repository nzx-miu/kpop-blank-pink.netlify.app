    <br/>
    <p>The online submission is unfortunately blurry. I got a 2nd rfe on oct 23 2017 and according to the counsel is identical to the 1st rfe. Received notification of another rfe, 3rd time will be the charm hopefully 06/22/2019:</p>

    <p>Once uscis receives your response to the rfe, the adjudicator will issue a notice of receipt with an expected timeline to review your newly submitted evidence. In the event of an rfe, you will typically have 87 days in which to respond. What is the next step after rfe?</p>
