        <p>Secondly, we know ‚Äòcry for me‚Äô is not necessarily a super sad song (at first listen), and twice doesn‚Äôt have many sad, sad songs. In his video, jungkook sang the first verse up until the end of the first chorus. It&#039;s a compilation of twice&#039;s visuals, they look so amazing.</p>
