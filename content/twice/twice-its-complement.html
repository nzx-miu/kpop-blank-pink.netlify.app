        <h3>Complementary Angle Refers To The Angle That When Added Together Will Be Equal To 90°.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This means that one angle is 30 deg. This means that one angle is 30 deg. Solution let x be the unknown angle of the condition.</p>
        <h3>Find The Measure Of Each Angle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>90 + 30 = 2x + x, 3x = 120. Since they are complement , there sum is 90 degrees. 1 an angles measure is 12 less than twice its complement.</p>
        <h3>The Complement Of An Angle Is 30 Degree Less Than Twice The Angle.find The Angle.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If an angle is twice its complement, you can represent one angle as x and the other as 2x. The angle that is twice that value is 60 deg. When the sum of two angles equals 180 degrees, they are referred to as supplementary angles, which forms a linear angle together.</p>
        <h3>A 120 O B 90 O C 60 O D 30 O Easy Solution Verified By Toppr Correct Option Is A) Let Supplement Be X ∴Angle=2X X+2X=180 3X=180 X=60 O Now , Supplement = 2X=2×60=120 O Was This Answer Helpful?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>0 0 similar questions find the angle, if its supplement is three times of its complement. Compliment angle = a/2 , since a is twice angle this complement, a + a/2 = 90, supplementary angles add up to 90 degrees. Given, angle is twice its complementary angle.</p>
        <h3>Find The Measure Of An Angle Which Is Twice Its Complement.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since they are complements, their sum is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angles are x and 2x + 21. Translating the supplement of an angle is 10 more than twice its compliment we get:</p>
