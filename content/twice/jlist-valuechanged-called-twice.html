    <p><strong>List Of Jlist Valuechanged Called Twice Ideas</strong>. The fix is quick enough, but i was curious about why was happening, so i hacked up the following test program: Lists can have many items, so they are often put in scroll panes.</p>

        <p>In addition to lists, the following swing components present multiple selectable items to the user: A jlist presents the user with a group of items, displayed in one or more columns, to choose from. Naturally, lead your code to execute twice.</p>

        <p>This constructor in the jlist class will create a list that will display the elements from the array specified within the parameter. I recently encountered a bug in java where jlist will fire the valuechanged () method twice when changing a value with the mouse, and only once when changing a value with the keyboard.</p>

        <p>Which should fire valuechanged () (assuming listselectionlistener is added, and the selection is other than current selection). This method may also be called multiple times in the middle of one selection change.</p>

        <p>The jlist class also gives you the option of registering a listener on the list itself, rather than directly on the list selection model. Listselectionlistener listselectionlistener = new listselectionlistener() { public void valuechanged.</p>

        <p>I am using a jlist and add a listselectionlistener.but every time i click the item in the jlist once,it fires two listselectionevent because the valuechanged () is invoked twice.anybody know how to fix this? This method may also be called multiple times in the middle of one selection change.</p>

    <p>The first event says you deselected x and the second event says you selected y. The listselectionlistener actually gets called twice for each user selection. This works fine with one internal frame, but if i have multiple frames, and i click on any jlist within a frame other than the internal frame that was most recently.</p>
        <h3>In A Jlist, When You Change Your Selection, Then Two Events Are Indeed Generated.</h3>

    <p>Arranging items in a jlist component: The valuechanged() method of listselectionlistener is called when a selection is changed. Frances pat patel greenhorn posts:</p>
        <h3>In Addition To Lists, The Following Swing Components Present Multiple Selectable Items To The User:</h3>

    <p>Fortunately the listselectionevent has a getvalueisadjusting method you can call to check for this. Listening for changes to the selection in a jlist component: I want to get the index number from the jlist list and convert it to a int so i can use it as argument for a setter method in another class called menukaart.</p>
        <h3>To Handle List Selection Event, We Can Add A List Selection Listener To A Jlist, Which Will Notify Us When A Selection Is Changed.</h3>

    <p>Naturally, lead your code to execute twice. This section looks at two examples that show how to listen to list selection events on a selection model. Detecting double and triple clicks on an item in a jlist component:</p>
