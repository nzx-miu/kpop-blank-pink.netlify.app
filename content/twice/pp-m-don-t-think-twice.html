        <p>I was only maybe 17, but i sure as hell knew what he was talking about. So while i maybe think that dylan&#039;s version is the one, pp&amp;m&#039;s version was such a boon companion that i gave it the vote for sentimental reasons. I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind you could have done better but i don’t mind you just kinda wasted my precious time but don’t think twice, it’s.</p>
