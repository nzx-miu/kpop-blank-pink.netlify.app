        <p>Because f is differentiable, f is continuous, so f (2) lim f (x) — also, because f is twice differentiable, f&#039; is continuous, so 11m f &#039;(x) = f &#039;(2) exists. Let f be a twice differentiable function defined on r such that f(0) = 1, f&#039;(0) = 2 and f&#039;(x) not equal to 0 for all x in r. The function g is twice differentiable.</p>

    <p>If f and g are +ve, increasing, concave upward functions on an in terval i, show that the product function fg is concave upward on i. Let f (x) and g (x) be twice differentiable functions on [0, 2] satisfying f’’ (x) = g” (x), f’ (1) = 4, g’ (1) = 6, f (2) = 3 and g (2) = 9. Since the function h(x) = (2x 4 + 3x) 8 = g(f(x)) is really the composition of the function g(x) = x.</p>
