        <p>The first factory receives twice as much as other two factories combined this piece of information means that x = 2 ( y + z) hence we have the system of equations (1) x + y + z = 12 (2) x = 2 ( y + z) substituting (2) into (1) we get that (3) 3 ( y + z) = 12 y + z = 4. For example, there are three times as many cell phones as people in our house means that the number of cell phones is equal to three times the number of people.</p>

        <h3>All Three Equations Are In Standard Form.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Graph the solutions to the system represented by your inequalities from part a. The second equation based on number is: In other words, when you have 20 a&#039;s, you have 10 b&#039;s.</p>
        <h3>If There Are 4 People Then There Are 12 Cell Phones.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For example, there are three times as many cell phones as people in our house means that the number of cell phones is equal to three times the number of people. Algebra expressions, equations, and functions variable expressions 1 answer david drayer apr 29, 2018 2 × (x + y) explanation: I usually try to think of this in terms of ratios.</p>

    <p>She finished with 28 winners, twice as many as peer. Twice as many as before. Step 2solve the new linear system for both of its variables.</p>
        <h3>This Can Be Rephrased As X Was Twice As Much As Y So The Equation Should Be X = 2Y</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A is twice efficient than b a and b can both work together to complete a work in 7 days then find in how many days a alone can complete the work? Let x = wind instruments, y = string instruments, and z = percussion instruments. With the use of “as” it is clear that comparables are talked about.</p>
        <h3>Twice As Many Students Who Play A Wind Instrument Were Selected As Students Who Play A String Or Percussion Instrument Combined.</h3>

    <p>38 is nineteen times as many as 2 and 2 times as many as nineteen: At the basketball game, the tigers scored twice as many points as the sharks. 40 is twenty times as many as 2 and 2 times as many as twenty</p>
