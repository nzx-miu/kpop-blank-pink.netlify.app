        <p>The force of gravity on a 2.0 kg rock is twice as great as on a 1 kg rock. The 2kg rock has twice as much mass for the earth to pull on but it also has twice as much inertia for the pull to have to overcome.</p>

        <h3>Heavier Things Have A Greater Gravitational Force And Heavier Things Have A Lower Acceleration.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A 2 kg rock has twice as much weight as a 1 kg rock but it also has twice as much mass, i.e., inertia, and is twice as hard to accelerate. Leave a reply cancel reply. Draw a free body diagram of the spider and find its acceleration.</p>
        <h3>The Energy (Or Force) That The 2Kg Rock Has Is Twice As Great.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The two kilogram rock also has twice the mass/inertia as. Be 61.2 kg) what is the force of gravity on her at each of the following distances from the centre of the earth, measured in multiples of the earth&#039;s radius? The force of gravity is twice as great on a 20.</p>
        <h3>The Force Of Gravity On A 2.0 Kg Rock Is Twice As Great As On A 1 Kg Rock.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Why does the 2 kg rock not fall with twice the acceleration? The 2kg rock has twice as much mass for the earth to pull on but it also has twice as much inertia for the pull to have to overcome. At the earth’s surface gravity is about 10 n/kg.</p>

    <p>At 3r it is a ninth etc. The acceleration of both rocks is found by dividing their weight ( the force of gravity on them ) by their mass. Experts are tested by chegg as specialists in their subject area.</p>
