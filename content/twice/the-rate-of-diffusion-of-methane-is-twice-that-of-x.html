        <p>Let rate of diffusion of gas x, r 1 = a therefore, rate of diffusion of methane,r 2 = 2 a according to graham&#039;s law of diffusion r 1 r 2 = m 2 m 1 m 1 = molecular mass of gas x m 2 = molecular mass of methane = 16 g therefore, a 2 a = 16 m 2 squaring both the sides, 1 4 = 16 m 2 or, m 2 = 16 × 4 = 64 g hence, the correct answer is 1) 64 g The molecular mass of gas whose rate of diffusion is twice that of methane is.</p>

        <h3>If Helium And Methane Are Allowed To Diffuse Out Of The Container Under The Similar Conditions Of Temperature And Pressure, Then The Ratio Of Rate Of Diffusion Of Helium To Methane Is:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Diffusion occurs when gas molecules disperse throughout a container. The molecular weight of x isclass:12subject: We know, that the vapour density of gas and molecular weight is related as:</p>
        <h3>The Molecular Mass Of Gas Whose Rate Of Diffusion Is Twice That Of Methane Is.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>M c h 4 = 16 (approx.) The rate of diffusion of methane at a given temperature is twice of a gas x. We will assign the value of 1 (rate 1) for chlorine&#039;s rate of diffusion.</p>
        <h3>The Rate Of Diffusion Of Methane Is Twice That Of X.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The rate of diffusion of methane at a given temperature is twice that of a gas `x`. (rate 2)² = 1² × 70.906 ÷ 2.0156. We can rearrange graham&#039;s law:</p>
        <h3>Complete Step By Step Answer:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The molecular mass of x is divided by 32. 1471 27 states of matter report error. The molecular mass of x is (a) 64.0 (b) 32.0 (c) 40 (d) 80.</p>
        <h3>We Have To Find Out The Molecular Mass Of The Gas X·</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Effusion occurs when a gas passes through an opening that is smaller than the mean free path of the particles, that is, the average distance traveled between collisions. So we can write it as r c h 4 = 2 r x. The rate of diffusion of.</p>
