        <p>Doubling the length will double the resistance, but the wire also must get thinner as it is stretched, because it will contain the same amount of metal in twice the length. From the graph between current i and v identify the portion corresponding to the negative resistance (a) ab (b)bc (c)cd (d)de 2. Since the wire is stretched, the new length (l₁) is twice its original length, hence:</p>

        <p>Find its new resistance solution given resistance of wire = r ω r= ρl1/a1 when the wire is stretched to double its length, the radius will decrease as such the volume remains constant. Doubling the length will double the resistance, but the wire also must get thinner as it is stretched, because it will contain the same amount of metal in twice the length.</p>

        <p>Assume that the density and resistivity of the material do not change when the wire is stretched. This wire is melted down and from the same volume of material a new wire is formed that is three times longer than the original wire.</p>

        <h3>Since The Wire Is Stretched, The New Length (L₁) Is Twice Its Original Length, Hence:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>L is the length of the wire. When the length is tripled then resistance will also become three times. If a wire of resistance r is stretched to double of its length, then new resistance will be :</p>
        <h3>⇒ R ′ = Ρ 2 L A 2.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So as resistance inversely proportional to radius square, when radius is 2 times then resistance is 1/2² or 1/4. Expert answer 100% (25 ratings) let the original length be l and area of cross section. The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its area and directly proportional to its length.</p>
        <h3>&gt;&gt; If A Wire Of Resistance R Is Stretched T.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Correct option is a 4 r r=ρl/a Here, at first the length of the wire is stretched to twice its length. See the answer what will be the resistance r_stretched of the wire if it is stretched to twice its original length?</p>
        <h3>This Problem Has Been Solved!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the wire is stretched o twice its original length then new length of the wire l₂ = 2l. Their is no mention about change in length of wire, so length of wire is same. While considering area (cross sectional area of wire), it is inversely depending on radius square.</p>
        <h3>A L = A 1 L 1 A L = A 1 (2 L) A 2 = A 1</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Its new resistance will be: 1) it decreases by a factor 4 2) it decreases by a factor 2 3) it stays the same 4) it increases by a factor 2 5) it increases by a factor 4 We know the resistance of a material or conductor of resistivity ρ wire of length l and cross section a is given by, r = ρ l a.</p>
