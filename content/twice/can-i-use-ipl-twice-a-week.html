        <p>Unlike laser hair removal, ipl or intense pulsed light hair removal is generally considered to be much safer and less painful. Like all other hair removal methods, the body takes time to grow habituated to the new exposure, and hence, regularity is critical to ensure less unwanted hair.</p>

        <p>However, as a general rule for ipl hair removal treatments, this statement should not be followed. This means you can not do a session to frequent than once every two weeks.</p>

        <h3>You Will See The Fast Results Rather Than Skin Rejuvenation Treatments.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We do not recommend using it more than twice a week. You can use it on all parts of the body (including your face and brazilian). Personally, thankfully, i feel no pain.</p>
        <h3>No, Using Your Philips Lumea More Often Than Recommended Will Not Speed Up The Hair Removal Process.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can use the titan more than twice a week but be sure to leave at least a day in between treatments to allow your skin to rest and repair itself. I don&#039;t have this ipl, i use the smoothskin one. Mine says that it isn&#039;t advised to use more than once per week because you won&#039;t get any further gain from it in terms of hair reduction but you increase your risk of irritation.</p>
        <h3>Different Filters Are Available On Many Ipl Devices To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It just usually takes more treatments. Put the nozzle in full contact with the skin to make sure the product works correctly. If there is inflammation in the skin at the time of ipl treatment there is a risk of skin burn.</p>
        <h3>Can I Use Ipl Twice A Week?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These bursts of light are changed into heat energy, eventually damaging or killing the root of the hair shaft and follicle so it stops growing. You get minimal to no added benefit if you get your laser hair reduction treatments at 2 week intervals or less. As you can see, how often you use the product will depend on your hair washing and maintenance routine.</p>
        <h3>Is It Ok To Use The Ipl Hair Removal Twice A Week?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Why do i need to use the ipl so many times? Select the standard head or the precision head depending on the size of the area you wish to treat. Once acne is gone, stop using it.</p>
