        <p>Kpop takes the time to cultivate because they probably take much more pride in the art of pursuing music as a career thats probably looked down upon in society. Japanese pop music is known around the world but lacks the popularity it once had.</p>

        <h3>No Better Than Other Kpop Girl Groups.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Red velvetâ€™s irene, stray kidsâ€™ bang chan, etc.) sometimes the leader can be the member who was a trainee for the longest period of time out of all the members of the band. Whereas japan has a solid music industry and music isnt as frowned upon. Kpop takes the time to cultivate because they probably take much more pride in the art of pursuing music as a career thats probably looked down upon in society.</p>
        <h3>Jpop Is Unique And Intersting Unlike Kpop Which Is Just American Pop With Korean Lyrics.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However thats why jpop is jpop you wont find that kinda music anywhere else for this long especially lol. How ridiculous you comment is. Reactions 14,862 posts 25,286 gender male.</p>
        <h3>What Is Better In Your Opinion, Jpop Or Kpop?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Of all korean girl groups, girls&#039; generation has the longest catalog of title tracks. I seriously doubt that ratio has. Jpop is better than kpop in my opinoin groups like bts , exo , nct 127 , big bang and kana boon and uverworld which are jpop and kpop groups and in this vide.</p>
        <h3>But They Are Both Better And Even When It Has Similar Name, The Culture Behind It Is Different In Both Countries.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jpop is always better than kpop. So #letsfight!support me on patreon: Personally i think that kpop is a lot more pleasing to listen to, jpop is just too much.</p>
        <h3>Legal Streaming Sites Don&#039;t Support The Industry, Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon Is A Good Anime, And Bts Aren&#039;t That Great.</h3>
