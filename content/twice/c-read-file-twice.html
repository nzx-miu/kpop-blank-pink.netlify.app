    <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing. If for some reason you don&#039;t like it, you can always close, and then reopen the file, same as the first time. The working mechanism of this source code is similar to above source code.</p>
        <h3>Copy The Last Line Twice?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Fclose (fp), then fopen, just like before. It creates the file if it does not exist. Just follow closely the chain of events.</p>
        <h3>So When I Am Rewriting My New File, I Read From The Vector And Write To A Txt File, And Since The Last String Is Recorded Twice, It Is Then Written Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I am trying to read the same file twice,but after the first reading it is not taking the value again. Close the file object newfile using close () method. I would like to avoid that by checking if the last character of the file is not \n.</p>
        <h3>So I Suspected That It Was Because Of The Background Process That Read From Fd5, Leaving Sx Nothing.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jaybob66 (534) as mikeyboy said, except if you want to read it twice without closing it you can call fseek () to move the read pointer back to the start of the file. If file is open then input a string ‚Äútutorials point in the tpoint.txt file. If so, read it into an array and you can access the lines as many times as you wish:</p>
        <h3>I Wasn&#039;t Sure Until I Downloaded A Freeware Program Hhd Hex Editor.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I &#039;ve been searching all over the internet for a way to read a file twice but. If file is open then declare a string ‚Äútp‚Äù. Call open () method to open a file ‚Äútpoint.txt‚Äù to perform read operation using object newfile.</p>
