        <p>Electricity is included in the rent at your dorm. Material scientists from the mccormick school of engineering at northwestern university have created a new type of carbon nanotubes solar cell that is twice as efficient as its predecessors. That means achieving the same goal with as little energy as possible and covering the remaining demand as far as possible with renewable energies.</p>

        <h3>(Ii) A Is Twice As Efficient As B, In Completing The Work W.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A is twice more efficient than b and he can complete the work 12 days carlier than b. Material scientists from the mccormick school of engineering at northwestern university have created a new type of carbon nanotubes solar cell that is twice as efficient as its predecessors. A is twice efficient as b and together they do the same work in as much time as c and d together.</p>
        <h3>If A,B,C Work On Alternate Days With A Starting Firs, In How Many Days Will The Job Finished ?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Epfl/alain herzog with a 36% yield, the solar panels. A is twice as efficient as b (1/a) = 2 (1/b) b is thrice as efficient as c (1/b) = 3 (1/c) if n is the number of days required for all three working together, n[(1/a) +(1/b)+(1/c) ] =1. For his work, a gets rs.</p>
        <h3>Twice As Efficient Ac Pro 20 Seer Air Conditioner &amp; Heat Pump A System That Delivers Everything You Want, Just How You Want It The Pro Series Is About Control.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The ratio of the number of alone working days of c to d is 2 : It‚Äôs about creating your environment, your way. Hence, (x‚àí12)= 21 x ‚à¥2x‚àí24=x ‚à¥2x‚àíx=24 x=24 days</p>
