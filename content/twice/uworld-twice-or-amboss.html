        <p>At that speed many of you would be able to read this article twice in the time it takes for a single question. I am unsure if i spoke to multiple different representatives but i was so frustrated i asked to speak to a manager or higher up twice and was ignored both times.</p>

        <p>And if you did divine which were most helpful (rapid review/shelf review/random) and if you didn&#039;t receive your result today you can mention it. I wanted to thank everyone at uworld for the outstanding job you are doing.</p>

        <p>Thanks to your ccs interactive practice software, i achieved an above average performance in solving the ccs cases, which pulled me over the top. Uworld is a fantastic resource (it really is).</p>

        <h3>Uworld Is Almost Always Great For All Your Rotations.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Therefore, doing it more than once will somehow boost your score even further. Making videos based on what questions you guys ask, so keep asking them :) please let me know if you have any questions. Candidate “if you want to do well on usmle step 1, do two passes through uworld.”.</p>
        <h3>I Would Appreciate Any Advice!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Honestly, you should be able to get a great score on your shelf exam by going through uworld 2x. With thousands of questions to grind through before test day, many students have a hard time imagining how they’ll make it through a single pass of the uworld question bank. The amboss library without the questions is pretty cheap and is an organized and quick resource to look up info.</p>
        <h3>On Average A Single Question Takes About 1 Minute To Answer And 2 Minutes To Review.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Uworld is not the place to be learning information. (cms/no cms) (amboss /no amboss) etc. Repeat uworld at least twice.</p>
        <h3>Unpopular Opinion From Someone Who Just Took The New Exam:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>(time from exam) uworld second pass : I wish i solved the amboss earlier though. And what approach do you guys use in reviewing blocks of questions.</p>
        <h3>(Even At The Expense Of Another Qbank).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>(4) hit me with difficult questions that provided a reality check, which kept me focused, motivated, and sensible about my step 1 goals. The only critique i have heard of amboss questions is that sometimes they can be more nitpicky and throw in a ton of red herrings so they can be more difficult than the uworld questions and even the shelf questions. Hope you kill this exam</p>
