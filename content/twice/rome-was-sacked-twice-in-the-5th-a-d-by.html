On the night of 24 august 410, rebel slaves, a suborned official, or some other unknown party quietly opened the gates of rome to admit the visigoths.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>What if rome never fell? Honorius moves the capital of the western empire to ravenna. The final blow came in 476, when the last roman emperor, romulus augustus, was forced to abdicate and the germanic general odoacer took control of the city.</p>
        <h3>After Having As Commissioners Of Inscriptions Were More Interested Besieged It Twice In Previous Years.</h3>
