        <h3>Using @Angular/Forms And Following The Standard Tutorial, If I Click The Submit Button Of My Form, The Ngsubmit () Event Is Fired Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>What i want was one button to delete a question and when you click it again, it undoes that action. It can be used to show/hide some element or it can popup alert when button is clicked. Now when i press the button i noticed the function has been fired twice.</p>
        <h3>The “Click” Dom Event On The Button Element Fires The “Click” Output Which Calls The Event Handler.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Expected/desired behavior the ngsubmit event shall be fired only once when is clicked. The first time it deletes the question, the second time it undoes that action. Combating angularjs executing controller twice.</p>
        <h3>Can Confirm It Is With Ngtouch, As Removing It Caused The Issue To Disappear.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Suppose if you want to add and fire a click event on html button click that time we need to use this event. Categorized as angularjs tagged angularjs. Html 7 1  2 3 registration for { {data.eventname}} 4</p>
        <h3>I Am Doing Something Like This.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When you place it in the label and click the label, it will trigger the click of the check, which will in turn bubble up to the label, thus firing twice. However i discovered a bug which i have been try. I created an angular validator module for form validation without the need to include ngmessages in the form and everything is working as expected.</p>
        <h3>If You Don&#039;t Want This Behaviour You Can Prevent Default Perhaps.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>An expression to execute when an element is clicked. When i view the call stack for the first execution, this is what i see: I&#039;m developing a cordova/ionic app, and currently using the android emulator on my laptop to test it.</p>
