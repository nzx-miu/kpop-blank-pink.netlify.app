        <p>Jeongyeon deserves way more lines and more screentime, or at least a solo debut to make up for being overlooked at this point. Consisting of seven tracks that features various genres including latin pop, new jack swing, bass music, and tropical house, the ep. What made me really start to think that nayeon was gradually taking on the title were their more recent comebacks.</p>

        <h3>What Made Me Really Start To Think That Nayeon Was Gradually Taking On The Title Were Their More Recent Comebacks.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Some songs seem like nayeon featuring twice. Nyt clues / by nate parkerson. Her voice stands out way more than the other members and she has a great vocal range.</p>
        <h3>Usually Twice Songs Follow A Formula:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twitter, instagram first music show win: Infact, i like her rapping voice! Jeongyeon deserves way more lines and more screentime, or at least a solo debut to make up for being overlooked at this point.</p>
        <h3>I Mean Look At Jeongyeon, Twice&#039;s Other Lead Vocal.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Haewon &gt;&gt; jeongyeon &gt; nayeon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yeji. Îã§ÌòÑ), is a south korean singer and rapper. Like blackpink, twice has a pretty strong vocal line.</p>
        <h3>I Feel Like Even Some Of Twice‚Äôs Sub Vocalists Have Potential To Be Lead Vocalists, Like Mina, Chaeyoung, And Sana.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But then again, three might be a bit small and there is always room for another one. I think jeongyeon is also considered a lead vocal anyways if we&#039;re getting technical into their vocals then. However, if dahyun had recieved consistent training in vocals, she could 100% be a lead vocalist.</p>
