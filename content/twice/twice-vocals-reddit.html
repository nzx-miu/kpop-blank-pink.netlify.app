        <p>I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re exceptional, but they are certainly not the worst. This poll is not meant to create any fan wars at all.</p>

        <h3>Twice Have Vocals, Jihyo Is A Good Singer Her Voice Is Very Unique I Haven&#039;t Really Heard A Voice Like Hers In Kpop, Deep Sultry Vocals.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There are six of them. No resonance is produced at all. Daniel fungmake a request/vote for requests:</p>
        <h3>I Wanted To Do One With Their First Mini Album Release, But With Page 2 Out, I Feel I Have Better Sense Of Their Vocal Range.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Although they did not sound perfect, the members’ raw vocals brought the fans at the concert the most authentic experience. This is harsh critique coming from a jaded once. Prefacing this by saying of course this is not a hate post.</p>
        <h3>Her Singing Is Quite Good She Could Definitely Be A Lead Vocal But She Lacks Emotion In Her Voice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re exceptional, but they are certainly not the worst. Sadly the rest of the group is really quite weak (including michaeng). Jihyo, nayeon, jeongyeon, momo, sana, mina, dahyun, chaeyoung, and tzuyu.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>Mina, chaeyoung, tzuyu, sana, dahyun and especially momo. It is time that twice had an intervention regarding their vocals. Do not bash at anyone made by midgehitsthrice (credit to chooalte for the original idea) who is the best vocalist/rapper in twice for you?</p>
        <h3>Hope You Enjoy~ Who Is Your Top Twice Singer?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Three amazing vocalists sadly overshadowed by their other six. Twice is a group that is hated on here and there for their live vocals that this fact/opinion has been unpopular. They do not present themselves as such and that&#039;s fine.</p>
