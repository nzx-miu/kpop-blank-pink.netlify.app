    <p>However, they may only take 80. If a regular payment fails, we try to take it again later. So the longer you hold the bond (up to 30 years), the more it is worth.</p>

        <h3>If The Payment Has Been Taken Twice, And The Bank Say The Restaurant Have To Cancel The Transaction, Just Tell Them To Cancel The Transaction That They Think Is 0.</h3>
    <br/>
