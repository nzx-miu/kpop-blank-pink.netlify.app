        <p>The volume of a cube is calculated as side 3, i.e., (side × side × side) cubic units. With 1 mint you will receive 2 cubes that will reveal themselves regarding 2 different scenarios: If this is part of a problem, say twice a number x is 6, then we can rewrite algebraically as 2x=6;</p>

        <p>Usually this indicates to multiply by 2. The fact is, any number can be a cube root, since you can cube any number by multiplying it by itself twice.</p>
