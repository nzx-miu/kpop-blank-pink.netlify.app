        <h3>While Searching On The Stack Overflow</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Because something there is causing the double call (of. For a windows forms or a wpf control, you can use the invokemethods method to invoke a sequence of nested methods. } } this causes the constructor of the viewmodel to be called twice, once by the command and once by the constructor of the view.</p>
        <h3>That&#039;s Pretty Easy To Use:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you need the loaded event to do some initializations you could use a flag and to do your initializations only if the flag is not raised and to rise the flag the first time you hit the loaded event. The button should requery canexecute () as soon as execute () returns, which it&#039;ll do instantly. Therefore unloaded cannot be assumed to occur only on navigation away from the page.</p>
        <h3>I Know That I Can Get Around This By Making An Explicit Call To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have 3 pages called search.asp, processing.aspx and confirmsearch.aspx. But the columns end up getting. A theme change causes an invalidation of the control template and the contained visual tree, which in turn causes the entire control to unload and reload.</p>
        <h3>(Or You Have Been Too Unespeicfic What It Calls Twice).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In order to avoid freezing the user interface while the file is loading, fetchfile returns immediately and then when example.js has been loaded the callback is called with the file contents. This example shows how to handle the frameworkelement.loaded event, and an appropriate scenario for handling that event. I noticed that my window.loaded eventhandler is triggered twice.</p>
        <h3>Public Methods That The Msdn Defines For The Control.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Xtrareport events are fired twice when report is generated, so it is causing the page load twice; &lt;%@ page language=vb autoeventwireup=false codefile=layout_grayskin.aspx.vb. Page.ispostback method and also had autoeventwireup = false and also run.</p>
