        <p>I have had a similar issue with my bill. Some credit balances aren&#039;t eligible for a payment refund and will apply toward your future monthly charges.</p>

        <h3>What I Spouse To Do.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hi my name is kulveer and here i would like to tell that public mobile charged me twice in a same day 24.45$ and 28$. But i realized i’ve been charged since then. Canada wide | unlimited text/pic msg | 75.00.</p>
        <h3>Still Being Charged On Expired Card.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>They clearly see in the system i was charged twice but then they send text messages denying my claim! And the first customer service agent said it has been taken care of. New customer being charged twice through autopay every month.</p>
        <h3>It Has Posted /Cleared And Is Paid For But The Rep Tells Me No, Happens All The Time.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This update allows your card to continue to be charged, even if it&#039;s expired. Mine&#039;s going to do the exact same thing when i get my bill next month. The problem, is that they&#039;ve charged me again at the usual date via direct debit, so i&#039;ve ended up paying twice.</p>
        <h3>Some Credit Balances Aren&#039;t Eligible For A Payment Refund And Will Apply Toward Your Future Monthly Charges.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I&#039;ve tried opening a complain but didn&#039;t get an answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and of course they couldn’t get a hold of one! This is a frequent occurrence with freedom.</p>
        <h3>I Found Out About The Additional Charges In July And Contacted Customer Service.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can remove or update your payment information at any. Don&#039;t forget to hit the thanks button if i&#039;ve helped. If you make an extra eip payment in this time, you are charged twice.</p>
