        <p>Ask the seller to refund your payment and cancel one of your purchases. I just stopped using my debit to buy on ebay and only use paypal now, as it doesn&#039;t incur.</p>

        <h3>My Bank Will Fight It Out And If Necessary Reimburse Me Themselves.</h3>

    <p>• clicking the heading ‘report a problem’ and then clicking the ‘report a problem’ button. They make spending or withdrawing money fast and simple: I have been charged and paid the seller the original sum of $61 (rounding)then ebay has a pending against my account for $91.again i paid the seller $52 and ebay still has a pending of $198 against my account.</p>
        <h3>I Showed Them Proof That I Had Paid The Accounts In Full To The Seller ,Now Ebay Will Not Take The.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You should have caught this on your second attempt. Charged twice for ebay purchase. I then get charged again and it takes out $89.87 from the rest of my paypal account (dropping me to $0.00) and $47.28 from my bank.</p>
        <h3>Ask The Seller To Refund Your Payment And Cancel One Of Your Purchases.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have been charged, twice, by ebay for delivery on an item which i posted, and paid for at my post. Just swipe your card, enter your pin and be done with it. I didn&#039;t order 2 i ordered one and from my purchase history it&#039;s only coming up with what i actually bought i&#039;m really confused and concerned about my money being taken twice.</p>
        <h3>I Made Sure To Go Back To My Ebay Page And Make Sure I.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Fortunately, this type of mistake is usually easily resolved. So, i logged into paypal today to check out how my payments from ebay buyers were doing. Twice 3rd album formula of love :</p>
        <h3>Authorization Hold (Also Called Card Authorization, Preauthorization, Or Preauth) Is The Banking Industry Practice Of Authorizing Electronic Transactions Made With A Debit Card Or Credit Card, And Holding The Balance As Unavailable.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>About 20% of my sales are international and i&#039;m temporarily holding off shipping outside of canad and. Ebay puts the verification hold through and then also puts the actual charge through, so it does charge my account twice, but the hold will then go away in a day or two. If the seller has already shipped, return the item for a refund within 14 days.</p>
