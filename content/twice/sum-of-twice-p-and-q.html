    <br/>
    <p>The result is their sum or total. The sum of the quotient of p and 14, and the quotient of q and 3? Does twice the sum of 16 and a number mean 2*16 + x or does it mean 2*(16 + x)</p>

    <p>P is two years older than q who is twice as old as r. Two times the product of a and b divided by 5. Subtraction of z from y.</p>
        <h3>Now, S P + Q = 2 P + Q × [2 A + (P + Q − 1) D] = 2 P + Q × [2 A + (P − 1) D + Q D] = 2 P + Q × [P 2 Q + Q (Q P − 2 (Q + P) )] = 2 P + Q × (P 2 Q − 2 Q − 2 P ) = − (P + Q) Was This Answer Helpful?</h3>

    <br/>
    <p>Total age of p, q and r will be 10 * 3 = 30 years. Times tells us to multiply and sum tells us to add. So, the measures of the two supplementary angles are 60 ° and.</p>
