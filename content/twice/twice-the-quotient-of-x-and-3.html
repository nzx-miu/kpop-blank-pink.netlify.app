        <h3>Let&#039;s Look At Some Examples Of Writing Algebraic Equations.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Five times a number n added to six. The quotient of the square of r and 6. Twice the sum of x and three d 2.</p>
        <h3>R + 45 = 79 X / 7 = 13 Twice = Double = 2 Times A Number = Multiply By 2 Addition Phrases Expression Subtraction Phrases Expression 8 More Than A Number The Sum Of 8 And A Number X Increased By 8.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The key word is difference, which tells us the operation is subtraction. Less than the product of and a number z 4. The sum of twice a number and 3.</p>
        <h3>Quotient Of, The Ratio Of, Equal.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>15 = 3 * (2 + x) = 6 + 3x. X + 2 will represent the third integer (the above can be thought of in the following way: Explain giving two reasons when a person is entitled to claim for uif benefits</p>
        <h3>What Is Twice The Quotient Of 50 And The Sum Of A Number Y And 8?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The quotient of x and y decreased by twice z. Write each sentence as an algebraic equation. In this problem, those two parts are 2 and 3 less than a number. looking for the key word and is an important strategy.</p>
        <h3>O Four Less Than The Quotient Of A Number Cubed And Seven, Increased By Three:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A number increased by nine is fifteen. What is twice the quotient of 50 and the sum of a number y and 8? The quotient of #x# and #y# means that we will have to divide the numbers:</p>
