        <h3>You Can Contribute Upto 100% Of Your Basic Pay Into Your Pf Account.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can instruct your payroll dept to deduct extra amount and this is called vpf. However, employers can limit the pf deduction to 12% of ₹ 15,000 even if the basic salary is higher. It is wrong if an employee&#039;s pf is deducted or not paid by the employer.</p>
        <h3>N India, For A Company Employing 20 Or More Employees On Salary, The Pf Deduction Is Mandatory For A Person Whose Salary Is Equal To Or More Than 6500.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Provident fund contribution is mandatorily either of the following: So total contribution becomes 24% of basic salary. However, form 16 will give the details of 1st part,i.e, salary and deduction of pf, being employee&#039;s own share will be taken for deduction under section 80c.</p>
        <h3>The Pf Has To Be Deducted From The Salary @12% By Employer &amp; @12% Of Employer.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since 12% is already deducted mandatorily, you can instruct them to deduct upto 88% more. This means that even if the employee&#039;s salary is above rs 15,000, the employer is liable to contribute only on rs 15,000 that is rs 1,800. After realising the dues, the pf members will be given full interest for each due month and it will in no way affect the interest due to members on the contributions paid.</p>
        <h3>Pf Is Calculated At The Rate Of 12% On Basic Salary.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The employer shall be charged penal interest under section 7q and penal damages under section 14b of the act respectively. The employer cannot recover the share of funds from the salary of its employees either. Coming to the gratuity, now a days.</p>
        <h3>Any Company Violating This Rule May Be In Trouble.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Visit the government’s epf portal. Deducted is fixed to 12% out from basic salary deducted both from the employee and the employer share. The pf deduction is not decided by the employer or employee when salary is upto rs.</p>
