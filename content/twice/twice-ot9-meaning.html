        <p>When people talk about groups like snsd and say ot9 or exo and ot12, they&#039;re talking about the original number of members in the group. For example, some old red velvet fans will refer back to the times before yeri was a member as ot4, or exo fans will sometimes only support ot9, the number of members left after kris, luhan, and tao left. None of our dinner menus are exactly the same twice over.</p>
