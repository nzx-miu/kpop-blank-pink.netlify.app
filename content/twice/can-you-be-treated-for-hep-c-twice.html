        <h3>For 95% Of People With Hepatitis C, The Exciting Answer Is Yes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The recurrence rate of hepatitis c in patients who are free of the virus at six months after treatment is extremely low (may be 1% or 2 %). For hepatitis c medications to be effective, they need to be taken as prescribed. However, hepatitis is often caused by a virus.</p>
        <h3>Ribavirin Is A Pill Taken Twice Per Day, As 2 Or 3 Pills In The Morning Plus 2 Or 3 Pills At Night, Depending On The Patient&#039;s Body Weight.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We now have data that goes out 5 to 6 years. Successful treatment does not give you any protection against another hepatitis c infection. But unlike current hiv treatment, hepatitis c treatment can lead to a permanent cure.</p>
        <h3>Further, It’s Important To Treat The Disease With Some Urgenc.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It&#039;s possible, but rare, for hepatitis c infection to reappear after apparently successful treatment. There&#039;s no vaccine for hepatitis c. By gina shaw health writer march 11, 2021.</p>
        <h3>The Purpose Of Taking Antiviral Medications For Hepatitis C Is To:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Pegylated interferon is taken weekly as an injection and ribavirin is a twice daily tablet. Whether you have a history of hep c or not, it’s important to take precautions to prevent hcv. So for the majority (more than 95%) of patients successfully treated, they can consider themselves essentially cured.</p>
        <h3>The Treatment Is A Form Of Chemotherapy And The Ability To Tolerate It Varies Widely For Each Person.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Heavy alcohol use, toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions can all cause hepatitis. After you clear your hep c (being cured) you won’t have any immunity to protect you from catching it again. Missing doses increases the risk of the virus becoming resistant to medications, according to the american liver.</p>
