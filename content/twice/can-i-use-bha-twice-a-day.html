        <p>Some people do well exfoliating with aha or bha twice a day, whereas others find that once a day or every other day is a perfect balance. “apply it once or twice daily after cleansing and/or toning.” however, i personally think that nobody needs that much exfoliation. The bottle is huge and lasts me at least 6 months even when i use it almost every day!</p>

        <h3>Apply Your Aha Or Bha Exfoliant After The Cleanser And Toner Steps In Your Routine.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Some people do well exfoliating with aha or bha twice a day, whereas others find that once a day or every other day is a perfect balance. This is why most experts do not recommend using both aha and bha at the same time. The bottle is huge and lasts me at least 6 months even when i use it almost every day!</p>
        <h3>Test To See What Works Best For Your Skin.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How often can you use it: Avril 3 2021, 3:00 pm. Test to see what works best for your skin.</p>
        <h3>How To Use The Ordinary Aha 30% + Bha 2% Peeling Solution Shop Chemical Peels The Bottom Line</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It is safe to apply on clean skin with other creams. Many people with stubborn clogged pores, have great results using a paula&#039;s choice bha exfoliant twice per day. It&#039;s probably a big angry skin tantrum.</p>
        <h3>31 Votes) The Simple Answer Is Yes, You Can Use Both Aha And Bha Together On Your Skin.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have the cosrx bha and used it twice a day initially and found it to be a bit too drying for my dry skin. Aha and bha are the skin caring products having hydroxy acids. Arbutin can be used twice a day.</p>
        <h3>Gentle Enough To Use Every Day To Keep Your Skin Feeling Soft And Smooth.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Less is more with peels. If you skin can take it, it&#039;s fine and may help if you have very oily or acne prone skin. You can use paula&#039;s choice bha every day— exfoliating once either in the morning or evening (pick whichever is most convenient for you).</p>
