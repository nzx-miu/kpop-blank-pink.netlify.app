        <h3>It Is Possible To Take The National Council Licensure Examination (Nclex) Tests Again If You Fail The First Time.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I passed my nclex exam on the third try using nursing.com! You’ve mastered surviving nursing school and have studied for the nclex once or twice and still have not snagged that magic two letters r and n, then perhaps it is time to stop in your tracks and make an effort to do a thorough assessment of yourself. During the actual nclex, i was clueless.</p>
        <h3>Because I Graduated In Mid May.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The day before my exam i kept it pretty chill and watched a movie to calm my nerves. There are several steps you can take. You can write them down or share them with your family or friends.</p>
        <h3>I Used Uworld My First Attempt And Failed In 78.</h3>
    <br/>

        <h3>What We’re Going To Do Is Look At Those Steps And Others And Help You Figure Out What.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>According to the national council of the state boards of nursing (ncsbn), you can retake the nclex up to 8 times a year. Sit back &amp; relax and enjoy my video on my experience with nclex &amp; the pearson vue trick. Failing the nclex may indicate that your study habits were not optimal.</p>
        <h3>I Took The Live Kaplan Course And Rescheduled My Test Date.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you’re an aspiring nurse who failed the test, there are strategies you can employ to help make your retake successful. Also used remar for content. Either way, it’s okay that you failed.</p>
