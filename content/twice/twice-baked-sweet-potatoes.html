    <br/>
    <p>To reheat, arrange the leftover twice baked sweet potatoes in a baking pan and bake in a 375 f oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until at least 165 f in the center.

        <h3>Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes Start With Tender Cooked Whole Sweet Potatoes And Then The Filling Is Made Extra Sweet And Creamy And Topped With Marshmallows.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Prick sweet potatoes all over with a fork. Directions watch watch how to make this recipe. Once sweet potatoes have cooled enough to handle, slice each potato in half and carefully scoop the flesh out into a mixing bowl (be sure not to tear the skins).</p>
        <h3>Preheat The Oven To 400 Degrees.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Set aside to cool slightly. Not only are they a terrific side dish, but they also make a great main dish for those folks who don’t care for meat. Add cream cheese, milk, sugar and cinnamon to potato flesh;</p>
        <h3>When Ready To Fill Shells And Bake Again, Preheat Oven To 400 Degree F.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In a large bowl, mash the pulp. Place potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil. Place 12 of the prettiest skins back on the baking sheet.</p>
