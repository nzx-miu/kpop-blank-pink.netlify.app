        <p>The biggest omission in the process of preparing for step one is beginning questions late. Done with step 1 9/28 ! A processing fee of 10% (minimum of $10 and maximum of $25) will be applied to all refund amounts.</p>

    <p>(2) taught me more medicine than my school lectures/syllabi ever did; If they&#039;re high yield topics, i make anki cards for each disease. Uworld questions are as close to the real thing as possible.</p>
        <h3>I Did Phase 1 (9 Weeks) While Still Taking Classes, Then Phase 2 (6 Weeks) During Our Dedicated Study Time.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>/r/mcat is a place for mcat practice, questions, discussion, advice, social networking, news, study tips and more. Do the passages and absorb all the information from the questions and answers. Next unread thread similar threads.</p>
        <h3>Subscribers Must Notify Uworld Of Their Intent.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Check out the sidebar for useful resources &amp; intro guides. I also made a uworld journal for the incorrect questions from my first pass with info regarding the disease i got wrong. Still waiting for scores, but i felt very prepared.</p>
        <h3>I Did All My Uworld Questions.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I think if you’re above 505ish on a diagnostic skipping content review would be fine and moving to uworld depending on your goal score. Start the questions as soon as. You will either get an average of your scores( mine was an average) or most probably a score closer to your best on assessments, because i know people.</p>
        <h3>Take A Look At Usmlexcellence.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>First assessment, i received a low chance of passing and second assessment i got a borderline chance of. They say you should go through uworld twice. 2 votes and 4 comments so far on reddit</p>
