        <h3>The Other Important Drawback Is If Your Request Body Contains 10 Gb Worth Of Stream, You Read That 10 Gb Data And Even Worse Bring That Into Memory For Further Examination.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In step 4 above is the body again available to the servlet, or does the filter somehow have to replace the. Logger output to console twice java; The servlet reads the body in order to perform its processing.</p>
        <h3>The Other Important Drawback Is If Your Request Body Contains 10 Gb Worth Of Stream, You Read That 10 Gb Data And Even Worse Bring That Into Memory For Further Examination.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For example, by a request.getparameter (), getparametervalues () or getparametermap () call. Tajo martino • 2 years ago this is a great article. First of all, it&#039;s somewhat inefficient, since for every request, request body is being read at least two times.</p>
        <h3>By Default, The Data From This Inputstream Can Be Read Only Once.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I am using apache fileupload jar file to get the request parameter from the stream. If the parameter might have more than one value, use servletrequest. If the request body is empty, then it simply means that it&#039;s already been consumed beforehand.</p>
        <h3>What You Need To Do Is Use A Servletrequestwrapper To Make A Copy Of The Body Of The Request, So You Can Read It With Multiple Methods.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>First of all, it&#039;s somewhat inefficient, since for every request, request body is being read at least two times. If the date is 20140401, fluentd starts to watch the files in /path/to/2014/04/01 directory. The first step is to read one of the request parameters and validate it.</p>
        <h3>The Request Moves Along To The Servlet.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Each of these methods relies on the same inputstream. So you see i need two passes of the request inputstream to fulfill my requirements. Just remove the lines doing those calls from your code.</p>
