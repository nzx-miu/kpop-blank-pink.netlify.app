        <p>This could mean adding in a day for speed work, a day to train a partial range of motion lift (trap bar, rdls, rack pulls), or a day for another variation to help you train areas where you&#039;re weak. You should be fine if your “heavy” falls under 225lb or so but beyond this, you are inviting trouble in the name of fatigue and plateaus by going heavy twice a week.</p>

        <p>The deadlift is just too taxing on the nervous system and you’ll just fry yourself by going heavy two or three. 3 sets of deads once per week.</p>

        <h3>Deadlifting Heavy Twice A Week Is Too Taxing On The Body For Most Trainees That We’ve Seen.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>There&#039;s also a lifestyle consideration that impacts this decision. Hey guys, got a newbie question for ya! Discussion in &#039;strength &amp; conditioning discussion&#039; started by captain_dammitt, apr 15, 2008.</p>
        <h3>So I Have Not Been Doing This For Long At All, So I Am A Lil Clueless As To How To Go About It.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Plus, squatting never goes well after deadlifting, as pulling is a lot more taxing. This is to allow sufficient recovery and prevent overtraining. Just a few weeks ago we tested the deadlift and he pulled 385.</p>
        <h3>The Various Lifts Live And Die By The Law Of The Jungle:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>One week, you handle that weight for twelve reps, the next week, you might struggle with eight. And, don’t push that set of five, just get the reps and save it for the last set. If you want to get really strong at a certain lift, don&#039;t do a lot of lifts.</p>
        <h3>Take A Backoff Week At 10% Lighter For 3×5;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How safe or unsafe would doing 2 different types of deadlifts (snatch grip and walkin deadlift) a week if your doing the other main lifts like power snatch and cleans and squats etc captain_dammitt, apr 15. My 1rm for the deadlift is 195kgs/429lbs. 3 x 3 x 90%.</p>
        <h3>And That Is Our Only Deadlift Session Of The Week.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Especially since one day is relatively light. If you&#039;re stronger, go with the push/pull system. This could mean adding in a day for speed work, a day to train a partial range of motion lift (trap bar, rdls, rack pulls), or a day for another variation to help you train areas where you&#039;re weak.</p>
