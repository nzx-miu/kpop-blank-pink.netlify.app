        <p>Taking 50, 000 units of vitamin d twice a week would be appropriate if your vitamin d serum level (25ohd) is very low or undetectable. Additionally, if your doctor is recommending it, it&#039;s likely d2, which is horrible for you.</p>

        <p>50,000 iu per week amounts up to 14,000 iu/per day, this is an aggressive dosage of vitamin d but nothing to be alarmed about. A weekly dosage of 50,000 iu of vitamin d is almost double the tolerable upper intake level.</p>

        <h3>Tolerable Upper Intake Level The Tolerable Upper Intake Level, Or Ul, Is The Maximum Amount Of A Nutrient That Is Safe For The General Population To Get Each Day On A Regular Basis.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Taking 50, 000 units of vitamin d twice a week would be appropriate if your vitamin d serum level (25ohd) is very low or undetectable. Taking 50, 000 units of vitamin d twice a week would be appropriate if your vitamin d serum level (25ohd) is very low or undetectable. Or just wanting to maintain the level?</p>
        <h3>Double Check With Your Doctor.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Longitudinal safety assessment of serum vitamin d, calcium, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) is important. These patients were then treated with 50,000 iu of vitamin d2 every other week and had a mean final 25 (oh)d level of 47 ng/ml. The chart below illustrates the effect of two different dosing intervals on the amount of vitamin d3 in the blood.</p>
        <h3>No Harm In Those Levels If Replenishing The Level Is Our Goal.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>50,000 iu of d2 is not the same as 50,000 iu of d3. If we cant take those, then we can take 10,000 ui twice a week or 5000iu thrice a week. But i&#039;ve read that the recommended dose is more like 1,000 iu a day, and that more than 2,000 iu.</p>
        <h3>Additionally, If Your Doctor Is Recommending It, It&#039;s Likely D2, Which Is Horrible For You.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>50,000 iu of vitamin d2 once a week for 6 weeks is typically prescribed by a dr for severe deficiency. However once i fell asleep, i stayed asleep until i woke up abruptly feeling like i couldn&#039;t catch my breath and my heart pounding. I took my first dose of 50,000 units of vitamin (d2) this past friday night.</p>
        <h3>A Cohort Study Of 56 Adults Oct 2012 Median 25 (Oh)D Concentration Was 6Ng/Ml.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Pregnant 70,000 iu loading dose then 35,000 iu weekly clinical trial. 50,000 iu vitamin d twice a week. You plausibly want to take d3 instead.</p>
