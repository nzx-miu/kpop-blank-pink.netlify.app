description: "On average, dpu should be around 600 and then you can adjust lower or higher depending on how you play. 400/800 dpi coz of the old days (i played myself with my 1.1a on 400, up until last year) desktop preferred sense."

    <p><strong>Incredible Is 800 Dpi Twice As Fast As 400 Ideas</strong>. Personally i turn my dpi up high and my in game low so that i can navigate the menus easier as the cursor moves farther. So basically if you have a full speed 1800 dpi mouse it&#039;s the same as having a 3600dpi mouse at 50% speed.</p>

        <p>This will ignore 50% of the counts delivered by the mouse, effectively dropping it. But another thing with dpi is that ingame mouse sensitivity amplifies distance of each point of movement, which means that if you raise ingame mouse sensitivity then after certain. Ive switched from 400 to 450 to 800 more times thna i care to remember but it comes down to preference.</p>

        <p>When the mouse to find more points in an inch, the greater the accuracy. Only scenario where problems might occur is 400 dpi with high sens and high res.</p>

        <p>As for the dpi, it is usually better to go low for fps games, though it. 400dpi for the win 16:9 1920x1080 or 1280x720.but stretched ez.</p>

        <p>I can&#039;t imagine being able to play with 800 dpi. I&#039;m a fucking dumbass 800x0.95 = 400x1.9 0</p>

        <p>Higher is better, adjust your sens accordingly, anything above 1600 is kinda dumb, i play on 800 but 400 is fine as well. So basically how dpi and in game sensitivity works, is that in game is a multiplier for dpi.</p>

        <p>You still choose your ingame sensitivity no matter what dpi your mouse is, anybody can get the same turn circle distance with any dpi by upping or lowering the game sens, you don&#039;t just load the game and play on its default setting. There&#039;s some mice out there that will act up due to artificially raising their dpi which can make it weird.</p>

        <p>400dpi 2 is the most recommended starting sensitivity to use. As the mouse find more inches per second, the greater the accuracy.</p>

        <h3>400Dpi For The Win 16:9 1920X1080 Or 1280X720.But Stretched Ez.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Full speed is no filter, half speed is 50% filter. If you wanted the mouse speed of 400 dpi but at 800 dpi, you would reduce the wps to 4/11 for a 0.50x multiplier. Just play for a couple of hours on 800, then go back to it the next day.</p>
        <h3>There&#039;s Some Mice Out There That Will Act Up Due To Artificially Raising Their Dpi Which Can Make It Weird.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I mean, 1300 dpi is already the slowest thing in the world for me. 1000dpi 4:3 1024x768 black bars. For example 1600 dpi is still 800 dpi, your cursor just skips for example a pixel everytuime you move the amount of 1.</p>
        <h3>400 Dpi With 2.5 Sens Is 2X Slower Than 800 Dpi With Same Sens.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As the mouse find more inches per second, the greater the accuracy. Depending on the sensor it might feel slightly different, but both options are perfectly viable. Mouse speed is a filter of dots/ticks.</p>
        <h3>Ime Higher Dpi With Lower Sensitivity Hinders Performance In Fast Paced Games Like Quake.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But around 1000 dpi mouses start to just double the amount your mouse cursor travels. As for the dpi, it is usually better to go low for fps games, though it. Battle (non)sense&#039;s tests would give different latency results if he moved his mice at different speed.</p>
        <h3>Higher Is Better, Adjust Your Sens Accordingly, Anything Above 1600 Is Kinda Dumb, I Play On 800 But 400 Is Fine As Well.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>400 800 dpi = cpi please search = 800dpi 0.8 is the same sensitivity as 400dpi 1.9 edit: 500hz has twice as much input lag as 1000hz.</p>
