        <h3>Nmixx, Jyp&#039;s Ngg, Is Debuting About 3 Years After Itzy Did.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As of february 2020, jype is partnering with republic records to help promote twice worldwide. Social media presence is pretty huge. She used extreme measures to lose.</p>
        <h3>Momo Revealed That She Was Told To Lose 7Kg (15 Pounds) Before Debut No Matter What, So She Lost The Weight In One Week.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The group made its debut in october 2015. As of 2021, nayeon is currently 26 years old internationally or 27 years old according to the korean age system. No one in twice was born in 1995 besides nayeon, making her the eldest eonni or oldest sister in the group.</p>
        <h3>The Investment Paid Off Almost Immediately.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Since then, nine of the group’s music videos have gained at least 200 million views on the platform. In this page you can quickly check the age of the twice members today, and on their debut. So anticipation was high when jyp announced the upcoming formation of twice in 2015.</p>
        <h3>Twice Received Contracts To Be Cf Models With 10 Different Brands Just 45 Days After Their Debut.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Park heavily invested into twice. This is what i like about sana. Frequent posts, promotion posts, a lot of pictures of their everyday life.</p>
        <h3>Index Of Articles Associated With The Same Name.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Their age is updated on load, so it’s always updated to their current age. Twice is one of the big three girl groups (alongside blackpink and red velvet), so it does make sense that with all the love and admiration they receive, they similarly also get hate. Vlive, instagram, twitter, youtube (kinda), etc.</p>
