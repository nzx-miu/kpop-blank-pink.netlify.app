        <h3>See The Documentation About It:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The reason the behaviour is different from qt, is that in qt the plot window does not appear in the output of the cell. This function was introduced in qt 4.5. An update from the one will trigger an update to the other.</p>
        <h3>Since Qt 4.1, The Contents Of Parent Widgets Are Also Propagated To Standard Qt Widgets.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If a widget has both the qt::wa_opaquepaintevent widget attribute and the autofillbackground property set, the qt::wa_opaquepaintevent attribute takes precedence. A qwidget has only one parent widget and only one geometry (position and size) in that parent. This is the same as document mode on macos.</p>
        <h3>This Property Was Introduced In Qt.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>See also removeaction(), insertaction(), actions(), and qwidget.addaction(). Widgets can display data and status information, receive user input, and provide a container for other widgets that should be grouped together. See also removeaction(), insertaction(), actions(), and qwidget::addaction().</p>
        <h3>Since You Can&#039;t Have The Same Widget Be Shown Twice (Qobject Class Can&#039;t Be Copied) And The Widgets Do Have A Parent Class (Mainwindow?) It Is As Msue Says, Use A Signal/Slot Connection Between Them.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Your second call of setlayout won&#039;t work as expected, because you have to delete the the existing layout manager before setting the new one: This isn&#039;t the case for qt, since it appears in a separate window. The reason is probably that either there has been no use case for this, or if any, it has not covered what the majority wanted.</p>
        <h3>A Qgraphicswidget Should Only Have One Of Each Action And Adding An Action It Already Has Will Not Cause The Same Action To Be In The Widget Twice.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Widgets are the primary elements for creating user interfaces in qt. The output is reset each time the cell is called. What you see with the inline figure is a.</p>
