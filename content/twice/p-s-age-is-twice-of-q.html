        <h3>P’s Age Is Twice The Average Age Of P,Q And R =&gt; P = 2 (P+Q+R/3) = 2 (S/3) Q’s Age Is Half Of Average Of P,Q,R =&gt; Q = 1/2 (P+Q+R/3) = 1/2 (S/3) The Age Of R = 5.</h3>

    <p>P q r s ⇒ the ratio of the ages of a mother and a daughter are in the ratio 3:1. A) 20 b) 25 c) 30 d) 35 e) none of these answer &amp; explanation the ratio between the a and b age is 7: In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son.</p>
        <h3>#Problemsonagesbyprabhakarsir #Careeradhyapanif P’s Age Is Twice The Average Age Of P, Q And R Ages.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Let the age of r be x then , age of q= 2x and of p=2x+2 now , according to question (x)+(2x)+(2x+2)=25 i,e. Easy solution verified by toppr p+q=40 2(p−5)+3(q−5)=70 2(40−q−5)+3q−15=70 2(35−q)+3q−15=70 ⇒70−2q+3q−15=70 ⇒q=15 p=40−q=40−15 =25 age of p=25 age of q=15. P&#039;s age = (2x + 2) years.</p>
        <h3>Q&amp;Rsquo;S Age Is One Half The Average Of P, Q And R&amp;Rsquo;S Age.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Five years ago, twice the age of p added to three times of age of q was 70 years. Q&#039;s age is one half the average of p, q and r&#039;s age. Let, age of q = x.</p>
        <h3>If Q Is 10 Years Old, The Average Age Of P, Q And R Is.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>P is two years older than q who is twice as old as r. P = 2*(p + q+ r)/3q = (1/2)*(p + q+ r)/3 and r = 5 solve these equations, we will get p = 20, q = 5 and r = 5 if p age is twice the average age of p, q and r age&amp;rsquo;s. R is half the age of q.</p>
        <h3>Neither Is Of The Same Age As The Others.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If the ages of p and r added to twice the age of q ,the total becomes 59.if the age of q and r are added to thrice age of p,the total becomes 68 and if the age of the p is added to thrice age of q and thrice the age age of r the total becomes 108.what is the age of p? The product of their ages is 363. So, q&#039;s age = 2x years.</p>
