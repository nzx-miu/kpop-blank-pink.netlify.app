    <p>Twice, both a song and an example of poetic brilliance, is only 4 stanzas long (two of which are a refrain) yet carries the weight and depth of a thousand stories. Supported by 4 fans who also own “twice”. And up spoke ink and up spoke blink, we’d have been three times as brave, we think,.</p>

    <p>Then you appeared before me. There are a bunch of remixes to this song, but most of them are really just the regular song with drums and they&#039;re pretty bad. The dragons grow throughout the seasons, and are used in battle for the first time in the 7th season.</p>
