    <p>Supplies of construction services and real property are taxed differently. So for a $100 purchase ($110 incl. That&#039;s assuming that the supplier would drop their ex gst price once they registered for gst.</p>
        <h3>Builder Can Opt To Continue The Existing Rate Of 8% Gst For Affordable Housing And 12% Gst For Other Residential Project, With Itc 2 An Intimation In Annexure Iv Shall Be Submitted To The Jurisdictional Commissioner On Or Before 10.05.2019.</h3>

    <p>When the job is completed and the invoice sent to the customer/client, the entire total (materials &amp; labour) has gst added to it. In addition, a subsequent sale of the house or condo unit by the builder will generally be exempt from the gst/hst. After the ruling, builders will now have to charge 5% gst on services bundled with affordable homes and 8% on others.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>Gst impact on the maintenance bill. But you shouldn&#039;t have to pay gst on the materials twice, no reason for that at all. Several builders, including some of the top players, were charging 18% gst on.</p>
        <h3>The Same Labour And Material Charges Are As Per The Previous Example.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Earlier this year, the gst council had decided that all new regular projects launched after april 1 would charge 5% gst to buyers, but builders can’t avail themselves of itc. And the cost is passed onto the customer, so yes, the customer is being charged gst twice even though it only appears once on their invoice, the other being part of the cost of the item. A builder will charge you full gst only.</p>
        <h3>The Works Contracts Has Been Defined I.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The gst you are liable to pay is equal to 1/11th of the sale price. Included in this price would be $27,727 of gst. However based on what you described it is hard to tell if you are or aren&#039;t.</p>
