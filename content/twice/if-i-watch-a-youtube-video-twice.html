    <p>Hello,i&#039;ll oye oye if one person i rewatch looping a my own youtube videos twice or too many times does it count as a one or two views and views will increas. Twice japan 9th single『doughnut』2021.12.15 releasetwice日本オリジナル楽曲史上初のバラードリードの作品！大切なあなたがいると満たされている心が. But it is against the ads clicking by the owner.</p>
        <h3>Now If A Video Is Shorter Than 30 Seconds So Youtube Will Treat It As Count On Complete Video Play.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Or do you try to reach out to new viewers? Watches at 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%; When i sign out of youtube, and go in as not signed in the video play, any suggestions?</p>
        <h3>It’s Important To Mention, However, That While Google Might Shell Out A Penalty To Your Site Because Of Duplicate Content, The Consequences Will Never Be As Severe As Youtube That Removes The Content And (On Occasion).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Afterward, you can increase your views by watching it for at least 30 seconds. Replaying a video would give a count. Also from my research, i’ve come across a little hitch in the incrementing.</p>
        <h3>If Your Video Is Used As An Ad On Youtube, We May Count Views Of Your Ad As Views On Your Video.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>So basically, if you want to artificially inflate views on your videos, get a bunch of your friends together in a discord call and all watch the video together over and over again. However, if another account watches the video afterwards (whether it be yours or another viewer), then viewing the video again gives a view. Join &amp; manage youtube premium;</p>

    <p>Create &amp; grow your channel; Youtube counts videos as they are started. The total watch hours for the channel will be impacted by deleting videos.</p>
