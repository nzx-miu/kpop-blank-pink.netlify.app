        <h3>Cause Microsoft Changed Activation Mechanism, I Don&#039;t Know How It Works Now.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The answer is no, you can&#039;t. Windows can only be installed on one machine. You can both use the same product key or clone your disk.</p>
        <h3>Can You Use Your Windows 10 License Key More Than One?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed computer at one time. If you have 3 copies of windows on 1 computer you must use different product keys for each one. Anytime you need to reinstall windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall windows 10.</p>
        <h3>The Best You Can Do Is To Have The Product License Or Key Moved To Another Computer.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, whatever the reason for wanting to use the windows 10 product key twice, understand that you can’t. [1] when you enter the product key during the installation process, windows locks that license key to. I have never seen anyone reach this limit personally.</p>
        <h3>In The Case That You Have Obtained A Retail License Of Windows 10, Then You Are Entitled To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>To download the media creation tool (click on download tool now), with that you can download the latest windows 10 iso (select create installation media for another pc), you can create a bootable usb flash drive (min 4gb) using that tool or create the iso file which you can later burn to dvd. If you have a retail copy of windows, you can move the installation from one computer to another. It is the same as having multiple computers.</p>
