        <h3>Let B Take 60 Days To Complete The Work, Working Alone.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I) a shall be able to do three times the work done by b in the same time. A is twice as good a workman as b and is therefore. ∴work done by a =2x.</p>
        <h3>Can You Explain This Answer?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Ratio of times taken by a and b = 1 : In how many days, they can complete the whole work working together?a)10 daysb)15 daysc)20 daysd)25 dayscorrect answer is option &#039;c&#039;. Ram can finish a piece of work in 16 days less than sham.</p>
        <h3>All The Three Took Up A Job And Received Rupees 1800 A… Nihalgkp24Pbcb8J Nihalgkp24Pbcb8J 04.07.2018.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Total time taken by a and b together to complete the work = 1/ (1/60 + 1/30) = 20 days. So a:b = 2:1 also (a+b) one day work = 1/18 to get days in which b will finish the work, lets calculate work done by b in 1 day = \begin{aligned} =\left(\frac{1}{18}*\frac{1}{3} \right) \\ = \frac{1}{54} \end{aligned} [please note we multiplied by 1/3 as per b share and total of ratio is 1/3] so b will finish the work in 54 days Total time taken by a and b together to complete the work = 1/ (1/60 + 1/30) = 20 days.</p>
        <h3>B Can Do The Work In 60 Days While A Can Do The Work In 30 Days.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If a is twice as good a workman as b, then: (a) ratio of work done by a and b is 2:1. So one divided by x equals to one divided by four minus.</p>
        <h3>A Is Twice As Good A Workman As B And Is Therefore Able To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Working together, they can do it in: Stay updated with the quantitative aptitude questions &amp; answers with testbook. A is twice as good a workman as b and is therefore able to finish a piece of.</p>
