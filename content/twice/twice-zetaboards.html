I&#039;m not sure how many folks are aware, but zetaboards was acquired by tapatalk nearly a year ago.while that move seemingly didn&#039;t bring about any immediate or obvious changes to the layout or the features of the forums that are hosted by zetaboards, i think we are going to see some fairly drastic changes in the near future.</p>
