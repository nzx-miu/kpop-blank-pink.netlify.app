        <p>Gzcl jacked and tactical (bench + squat only) via /u/whipfather this is a variation of jacked and tan that focuses on upper body hypertrophy.

        <h3>Gzcl Jacked And Tactical (Bench + Squat Only) Via /U/Whipfather This Is A Variation Of Jacked And Tan That Focuses On Upper Body Hypertrophy.</h3>

    <p>I figured i&#039;d upload the a full workout to give you guys a better feel of the gzcl programs. 3 board press w/ bands. 4th week t1 90%x3x1, 95%x2x1, 100%x1x3+.</p>
        <h3>It Is A 16 Week Program, Run 4 Days Per Week.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Second time is 95lbs,135,185, or 225 lbs for as many. 90% x 3 x 1 95% x 2 x 2 100% x 1 x 1+ t2: The more you do it, the more you&#039;ll improve.</p>
        <h3>So Roughly Only Hitting Each Lift Type Every 2 Weeks (Ex.</h3>

    <p>This is the free program spreadsheet collection offered on blaine sumner’s site. 95% x 2 x 5+ week 4: Take a moment to really dig deep and identify your individual weaknesses.</p>
        <h3>I Am Following The Jacked And Tan 2.0 Program Which Is A Bit Of.</h3>

    <p>By doing this, you can gain sufficient practice with the bench press technique, as well as plan different training adaptations (strength, hypertrophy, power) on separate workouts. Deadlifts are not programmed in this gzcl variation. Now you no longer use 5x3 for workout a2 bench press anymore.</p>
