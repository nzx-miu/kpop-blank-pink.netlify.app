        <p>/mnt is already mounted or busy however when using the option &#039;noac&#039;, the user is able to mount the same share on the same mountpoint multiple times. It would be great if i could mount the physical disk as ro in the host os and copy the data to an external usb drive.</p>

        <p>But as long as it is only two mounts, and none of the directories are accessible through more than one of the mounts, then i&#039;d say choose the option you find easiest to work with. Nfs does have cases where the semantics can be a little problematic, if files are accessed through multiple mounts simultaneously.</p>

        <h3>Mount Point Is A Directory On The Local Machine Where The Nfs Share Is To Be Mounted.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This article is focused on mounting with nfs, for details on mounting with smb, see use azure files with linux. Multiple nfs mounts when mounting multiple mounts from the same nfs export, attempting to override the selinux context of each mount with a different context, results in subsequent mount commands failing. Add fs set dir= set spezial= set type=lofs set options=nodevices.</p>
        <h3>The Former Only Contains The Directory Ro.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If i run mount /media/nas twice, the second one fails with the message: /mnt is already mounted or busy however when using the option &#039;noac&#039;, the user is able to mount the same share on the same mountpoint multiple times. In the following example, the nfs server has a single export, /export, which has two subdirectories, web/ and database/.</p>
        <h3>If You Create A Pv Using Nfs You Can Specify The Mount Options:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Take the following two mount commands: Ask question asked 8 years, 5 months ago. But i don&#039;t know how to get a pod to access a specific directory within a pv.</p>
        <h3>However Mount Command Has Bind Option To Remount Part Of.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Mount to dirs /home/data and /backup. However mount command has bind option to remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. Replace nfs.share.server.name with the name of the server the nfs share is on (eg.</p>
        <h3>Verify If The Nfs Fs Is Mounted Properly</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Instead of using the filesystem path, umount /mnt/temp/dir use the device path umount nfsserver:/some/share/. &gt; when you normally attempt to mount a share twice on the same mountpoint, a check in do_add_mount causes it to return an error &gt; &gt; # mount localhost:/nfsv3 /mnt &gt; # mount localhost:/nfsv3 /mnt &gt; mount.nfs: You will not able to do that.</p>
