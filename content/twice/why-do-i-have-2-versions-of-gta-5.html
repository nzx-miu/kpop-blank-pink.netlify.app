description: "Graphically speaking, this puts it way ahead of previous versions. For steam, just use 2 install folders, like &#039;gta v modded&#039; and &#039;gta v vanilla&#039; (these will basically be renamed folders of the original &#039;grand theft auto v&#039; directory)."

        <p>Also, its a bit strange that gta v is no longer on gamepass so why i have access to this other version is still a head scratcher. Grand theft auto v is the original that you currently use to play online, and gtavother is (currently) the one you&#039;re gonna mod.</p>

        <h3>The Fact That I Can Earn 2 Seperate Achievements Means Its A Different Version Of The Game Like The Witcher 3 Vs Goty Edition.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I was able to install them both without troubles. Not sure if it helps, but in case you own two different copies of gta 5 you can also keep them simultaneously! Grand theft auto v is the original that you currently use to play online, and gtavother is (currently) the one you&#039;re gonna mod.</p>
        <h3>Whenever You Want To Switch, Just Rename The Folders.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I want to be able to have mods (lspdfr) on my sp and have a clean version of the game to be able to play mp. Then create 2 corresponding batch files, like: Why do i have two different copies of gta 5 on my xbox one.</p>
        <h3>Saul Goodman, Attorney At Law. This Mod Changes The Billboard Located Near Yellow Jack Inn Into A Much Superior Billboard.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Grand theft auto v has three distinct editions; Certain title updates will feature new content, labelled as dlc updates. I&#039;ve tried to copy the original game folder to a different location than the steamapps/common but the folders seem to sync.</p>
        <h3>Or You Just Lost Your Mods/Save File.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I initially thought this was just a visual bug or one might be an xbox one x version so installed one. Graphically speaking, this puts it way ahead of previous versions. Also, its a bit strange that gta v is no longer on gamepass so why i have access to this other version is still a head scratcher.</p>
        <h3>Maybe One Of Them Is The Digital Version And One Of Them Is The Physical Verison.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have the dvd/social club version and also the steam version. Texture is custom made and has proper lods; Graphically speaking, this puts it way ahead of previous versions.</p>
