        <p>As given, capital of b is twice that of c, only options 4 satisfied the condition. For a (rather dry) mixture of 4/1 parts in volume of cement to water, it could be said that the ratio of cement to water is 4:1, that there is 4 times as much cement as water, or that there is a quarter (1/4) as much water as cement. At present the total of their salary is 4160.</p>

        <h3>If At Present, The Ratio Of Their Ages Is 5 :</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The ratio of b’s age six years hence to c’s present age is 5: The above proportion is so adjusted to have difference of 20 between them. This is clearer if the first number is larger than the second, i.e.</p>
        <h3>How Do You Write The Variable Expression For:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>What part of the tank is full? A quotient of 2 and the sum of a number and 3 ? Calculate the ratio of their weights present in the container.</p>
        <h3>Efficiencies Are A:b:c = 2:3:4.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>B is eleven years younger than a. If the total profit is rs 16500 at the end of a year ,find out b&#039;s share in it. Therefore we can conclude as follows:</p>
        <h3>In General, The Ratio Of The Numbers A, B, And C (B 0, C 0) Is A:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A:b:c=1/2:1/3:1/4 or 6:4:3 or 60:40:30. The ratio of partial pressure of c h 4 , h 2 and he, respectively is 2:3:5. Example 1 an oil tank with a capacity of 200 gallons contains 50 gallons of oil.</p>
        <h3>R C H 4 = 2 R X The Rate Of Diffusion Is Inversely Proportional To The Square Root Of Its Molar Mass.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Find the ratio of the number of gallons of oil in the tank to the capacity of the tank. The cut is given parallel to its circular base. The mass ratio of oxygen to carbon in co2 is 2.667 for every sample of co2.</p>
