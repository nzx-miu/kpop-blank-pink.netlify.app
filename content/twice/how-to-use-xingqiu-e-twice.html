        <p>This is due to xingqiuâ€™s e cd matching up perfectly with sacrificial swordâ€™s weapon skill cd (essentially you can almost e twice every time as long as you proc the weapon skill). When a sword rain attack hits an enemy, xingqiu regenerates 3 energy.</p>

        <p>Xingqiu is a character that has been neglected heavily by most of the global community due to a lot of miss informed tier lists ranking him badly, as well as having a pretty unique set that most people did not understand at first.meanwhile, he is most likely the best performing dps support character in the game and is definitely worth of an s+ tier support. On top of that, his normal attacks don&#039;t have anything special going for.</p>

        <p>On hit, the third sword rain attack also regenerates 3 energy for xingqiu. The both of them have been together for so long that they seek to find an additional spark to fuel their intimacy.</p>

        <h3>When A Sword Rain Attack Hits An Enemy, Xingqiu Regenerates 3 Energy.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>(4) using an elemental burst regenerates 2 energy for other party members every two seconds for. You can use xianglingâ€™s e and time it on goubaâ€™s attack. *i&#039;m not sure if this is really necessary though.</p>
        <h3>For The Build I Used, I Focused On Freeze Reactions And Crit Rate + Hydro Dmg Bonus.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The rain swords have the following properties: At the same time, this ability creates the maximum number of rain swords, which will orbit your active character. Amber ult can proc twice with xingqui e.</p>
        <h3>This Means You Can Crit Twice In One Move And Also Apply Two Stacks Of Vaporize Or Freeze With Yanfei Or Kaeya Respectively.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is due to xingqiuâ€™s e cd matching up perfectly with sacrificial swordâ€™s weapon skill cd (essentially you can almost e twice every time as long as you proc the weapon skill). The both of them have been together for so long that they seek to find an additional spark to fuel their intimacy. This is one of the best capstone constellations xingqiu could have, although its description is a bit weird.</p>
        <h3>Requires High Energy Recharge For Consistency.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you use xinqiu&#039;s e (skill) for vaping, the e doesn&#039;t apply the water aura fast enough, so often the water aura gets triggered by the n1 portion of your combo, consuming the water aura (vape dmg), leaving your c attack without any water aura. If your connection is good then it should connect. The fact that they live with two other hot dudes in their apartment may have something to do with xingqiu&#039;s new idea for fun.</p>
        <h3>On Top Of That, His Normal Attacks Don&#039;t Have Anything Special Going For.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>And then he grabs the nearest pillow and muffles a scream into it. Because of this, xingqiu works great with sacrificial sword and emblem of severed fate. Otherwise, at lower refinement, favonius sword will be.</p>
