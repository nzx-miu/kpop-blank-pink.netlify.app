        <h3>Your Body Will Become Immune To One Viral Infection That Caused The Disease, But You Can Still Catch A Different Virus That Causes Hand, Foot And Mouth.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hand, foot and mouth is caused by a range of different viruses, just like the cold and flu (which you can catch year after year). Hfmd is highly contagious and can be passed back and forth between family members. Hand foot and mouth is most common in spring and summer.</p>
        <h3>Hfmd Is Caused By Several Kinds Of Viruses.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The symptoms can be similar. Hfmd is caused by several kinds of viruses. Hand, foot, and mouth disease usually begins with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and feeling lethargic.</p>
        <h3>Because Hfmd Is Caused By Several Different Viruses, It Is Possible To Get The Disease More Than Once.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It is possible to get hand, foot and mouth disease more than once. So even if you &#039;ve had it, you can get it again — similar to the way you can catch a cold or the flu more than once. Yes, you can get hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfmd) twice.</p>
        <h3>At The Same Time Or Shortly After.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Hfmd is caused by several kinds of viruses. So even if you&#039;ve had it, you can get it again — similar to the way you can catch a cold or the flu more than once. In addition, after a child with hfmd sneezes or coughs, other kids can catch the airborne virus.</p>
        <h3>After Developing A Fever, Painful Sores May Develop In The Mouth.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I do think it&#039;s an interesting discussion, but it has also crowded out any comfortable ability to drop in once or twice a day and monitor the forums for patch, mod, or scenario news. You or your child could also contract hfmd through feces or fluid from blisters. Stay home from work, school and social events.</p>
