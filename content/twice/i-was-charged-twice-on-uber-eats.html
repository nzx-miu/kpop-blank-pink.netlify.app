    <p>If this happens, we recommend confirming that you haven&#039;t taken separate trips that happened to have the same fare. Your uber or payment account may show two or more similar charges for the same amount on occasion. Depending on where you live, where you order from, and how much you purchase, the fees vary.</p>
        <h3>My Order Was Charged Then My Order Was Cancelled By Ub.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sometimes you may see a charge listed twice and then 1 of the charges may fall off later on when you first request the trip uber has to check with your bank and make sure the funds are there so they do a authorization charge and then later on when the trip is finished they issue the final charge and a lot of situations the authorization charge will drop Restaurants may notify you if they run out of an item or can’t accommodate allergies or special requests.

        <h3>Email Receipt From Uber And The Funds Were Taken From My Credit Card, As Shown On December Credit Card Statement.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This does not mean you were charged twice. This is because when you first placed the order, we put a temporary charge, which acts as a hold, with your payment method. They replied with, &#039;an authorization hold is a pending charge placed on your account while we confirm your payment method&#039; and that it would be resolved within a few days.</p>
