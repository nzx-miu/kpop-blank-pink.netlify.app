        <h3>4(X + Y) Four Times The Sum Of X And Y.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Suppose we have two rational numbers a = m/n and b = p/q. The difference of 20 20 and 4 4. The difference of x and 3.</p>
        <h3>In This Case, X Is Described As Twice A Number T .</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dividend ÷ divisor = quotient (if the remainder is zero) the general formula for any division problem is given by: Twice a number is eighteen. The quotient of `x` by `y` added to the product of `x` and `y` is written as.</p>
        <h3>Y + 9 = 15:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The sum of twelve times x and y is twenty 8. In this case, x is described as twice a number t . In each case, write algebraic expression for the given verbal phrase.</p>
        <h3>The Key Word Is Difference, Which Tells Us The Operation Is Subtraction.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Twice z less than the quotient of x and y 4. The quotient of x and y  means that we will have to divide the numbers: The quotient of x by 3 is multiplied by y is written as (a) x/3y (b) 3x/y (c) 3y/x (d) xy/3.</p>
        <h3>Dividend ÷ Divisor = Quotient + Remainder.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>9 taken away from the sum of x and y is (a) x + y − 9 (b) 9 − (x+y) (c) x+y/ 9 (d) 9/ x+y. It can be written as. Look for the words of and and to find the numbers to subtract.</p>
