        <p>我理了一下，把 as many as提出来，变成twice as many as b is a，可能更能帮助我理解。. C) as much + uncountables = as much rain as.</p>

        <p>The objective of this problem is to design a pda that recognizes the language l of all strings over the alphabet {a,b} that contain twice as many a&#039;s as b&#039;s. But also, according to the problem:</p>

        <p>A) provide a careful and complete argument that will convince a skeptical but rational jury that every nonempty string of the target language l must contain at least one of the strings aab, aba, baa as a substring. I have a solution as the following.</p>

        <h3>I Have A Half As Much My Room Size As That Of The Room I Saw.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The airplane has twice as many engines as it requires. The size of a room i saw is twice (or two times) that of my room. The notation seems to follow an introduction to formal languages and automaton by peter linz, where δ is the transition function with three arguments:</p>
        <h3>Is Means Equals, Twice Means 2 Times, As An Equation That Is:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If a total of 109,000 votes were cast, how many votes did candidate b receive?. The answer (given a required 4 but extant 8) must be: Company a has twice as many employees as company b, and the two companies have no employees in common.</p>
        <h3>If 64 Percent Of The Employees Of Company A Are Women And 52 Percent Of The Employees Of Company B Are Women, What Percent Of All The Employees Of The Two Companies Are Women?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Road a is 300 km and road b is 100 km, therefore: As far as i know, a is twice as many as b is the same as twice as many a as b. Design a pushdown automaton that can accept.</p>
        <h3>They Must Produce Twice As Many A As B That Means If They Produce 10 B&#039;s, Then They Produce Twice As Many, Or 20, A&#039;s.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Candidate c received 15,000 fewer votes than candidate b. “twice as many a as b” means a = 2b. The size of a room i saw is twice (or two times) as much as that of my room.</p>
        <h3>In The Last Election, Candidate A Received Twice As Many Votes As Candidate B.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>He doesn&#039;t have as many collection stamps as you have. Twice as many a as b = two times as many/much of a as b. In the last election, candidate b received twice as many votes as candidate a.</p>
