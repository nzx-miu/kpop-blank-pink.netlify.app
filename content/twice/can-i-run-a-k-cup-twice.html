        <p>Don’t use a keurig pod twice. I have run tea cup through twice, but never the hot chocolate so you might try the low setting twice, like 4 oz twice.</p>

        <p>Instead, throw out the original coffee grounds and replace them with fresh ones. Be that as it may, you’re more probable just to get brown coloured water to a cup of decent coffee.</p>

        <h3>Can You Make A Cappuccino With A Keurig?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Instead, throw out the original coffee grounds and replace them with fresh ones. Choosing a bigger size in a keurig, however, immediately dilutes the taste on the first usage. (i repeat this info so often that sometimes the fingers just type, y&#039;know?)</p>
        <h3>Can You Run A Keurig Cup Through Twice?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Once you have added the fresh ground coffee, the reused k cup is ready to use again. Gently strain the book and give it about 3 minutes to cool. Why would you peel a keurig cup?</p>
        <h3>Regardless Of What Machine You Have, You Can Just Hit The Brew Button Again.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Keurig pods are made to be used only once. You should only use a keurig coffee pod once. You can use a k cup twice, but you shouldn’t use the same coffee grounds.</p>
        <h3>Yeah, Sorry For The Confusion:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When you run a pod through a second brew cycle, a few things might happen. Once the cover is recapped, sit for another 2 minutes. While you can save some money reusing them, the quality of your drink will suffer.</p>
