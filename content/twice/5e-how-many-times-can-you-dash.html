        <p>Technically, it doesn&#039;t double your move speed, because if you used both your action and bonus action (through the monk&#039;s ability or the rogue&#039;s cunning action) to dash, you would move 3 times your base speed, not 4 times. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this boon up to 3 times, it recharges on a short rest or long rest.</p>

        <p>So rogue would get 60 (standard movement) + 60 (action dash) + 60 (haste action dash) + 60 (cunning action dash) for 240ft of movement in one turn. It’s considerably more effective on a monk though, even changing the base move speed to 40 changes the final speed to 320ft.</p>

        <h3>In D&amp;D 5E, A Reaction Is A Special Type Of Action That A Player Character (Pc) Can Sometimes Take In Response To A Specific Type Of Trigger.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A game feature, such as an opportunity attack, doesn’t let you bypass that casting time, unless the feature says otherwise. When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. Technically, it doesn&#039;t double your move speed, because if you used both your action and bonus action (through the monk&#039;s ability or the rogue&#039;s cunning action) to dash, you would move 3 times your base speed, not 4 times.</p>
        <h3>A Turned Creature Must Spend Its Turns.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Each additional dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a dc 10 constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion. In fact, if you take a couple of fighter levels to get action surge, one per short rest you could dash again for a total of 120ft! Boon of leadership you can use your action to inspire your allies into greatness.</p>
        <h3>When You Consider How Many Different Heroic And Antiheroic.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Good the turn you use it, but it’ll be a while before you can do so again. The d&amp;d basic rules document is divided into three parts. Tap on the scheduled tab.</p>
        <h3>You Can Take One Action, Which May Be The Dash Action.</h3>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <p>Despite the player&#039;s handbook says nothing about that explicitly, your dm might decide that running exhausts you, using additional mechanics from the dungeon master&#039;s guide. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Additionally your damage can’t be reduced by any means short of invulnerability/immunity.</p>
