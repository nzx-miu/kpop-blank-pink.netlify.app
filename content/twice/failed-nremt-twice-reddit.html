    <p>It&#039;s not a test of you knowledge of the material but a test of trickery. Trishacarole jul 20, 2018 jul 20, 2018 #1 trishacarole forum ride along 3 0 1 i was passing in my class tests, passed the finals and the practical exams. Similarly one may ask, what percent do you need to pass the nremt?</p>
        <h3>You&#039;ve Gotta Work Through It.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, all continuing education requirement must have been satisfied prior to march 31. Again, sorry to be so harsh, but that&#039;s the reality of ems. Take several practice tests per day (between 80 and 100 questions) to keep you focused.</p>
        <h3>You Can Pass Quickly Or Pass Late (120 Questions) And You Can Fail.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Not being able to pass the registry exam or sitting 4+ times before passing raises some serious red flags for me. I signed up for emt prep and put in over 150 hours into the site. Emt tests can be difficult as they often have a &#039;best&#039; answer hidden among good answers.</p>
        <h3>States Have Individual Licensing Or Certification Organizations As Well.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Read that and study those section(s) again really hard. I&#039;m probably the only person in the history of sdn to fail his emt practical exam. I probably didn&#039;t put in as much time in it as i should have.</p>
        <h3>If You Fail A 6Th Time Then You Must, If You Still Wish To Continue As An Emt, Repeat The Entire Emergency Medical Technician Training Course Again.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The student who scores near the top of his or her emt class, but fails the nremt twice. I was above passing on airway &amp; breathing and everything else was below. Those that test in the winter months pass with flying colors.</p>
