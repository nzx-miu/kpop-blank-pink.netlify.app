        <h3>Zyrtec Is The Allergist’s Favorite For Hives And Food Allergies.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These may cause side effects like diarrhea, dizziness, and headaches. Also he takes 10ml of atarax syrup at night before going to bed, his itching is so severe and it really bothers him all night; I usually take a zyrtec once a day and benadryl at night if i have a flare up.</p>
        <h3>Although Zyrtec Is Unlikely To Make You Drowsy, Some People Are Susceptible To This Effect, Especially If They Are Taking Dosages At The Upper End Of The Recommended Dosage Range.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I was switched to zyrtec twice a day. We tried claritin, benadryl, hydroxyzine, pepcid and prednisone prior and none of these worked but zyrtec worked.” 10 / 10 was this helpful? There are a few situations where twice daily dosing has been used in children which is discussed below.</p>
        <h3>Can You Take Zyrtec 10 Mg Twice A Day?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I am 23 years old and eat relatively healthy. It stopped the itch, etc., but in that time, i had about 8 or more episodes of vivid dreams/nightmares.frightening! Both antihistamines have this on the front of the package:</p>
        <h3>Guess What, I Now Only Take Benydryll At Night, And A Week Later I Woke Up To.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can buy the above zyrtec over the counter now. Then, i tried limiting the zyrtec to every 3 days and benydryll at night. All of these antihistamines are indicated for adults and children two years of age and older, with zyrtec and claritin dosed once a day for all ages.</p>
        <h3>They Itched Like Crazy And Were All Different Sizes.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Allegra is dosed twice a day for children from two to 11, and once a day for adults and children 12 years and older. I still have hives everyday. Again, it controlled the itch but after about 5 months, the vivid, frightening nightmares began again.</p>
