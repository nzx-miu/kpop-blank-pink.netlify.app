        <p>Too much baking powder will create a very puffy pancake with a chalky taste, while too little will make it flat and limp. Counter clockwise output operation is achieved by inserting pressure into port ‘a’,to force the pistons apart thus rotating the actuator pinioncounter clockwise, during the operation, air from the outer chambers is exhausted through port ‘b’ , clockwise output operation is. The prs double acting truss rod achieves twice the amount of adjustment as the single acting rod with the same amount of movement of the adjusting nut.</p>
