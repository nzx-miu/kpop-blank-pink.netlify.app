    <p>How much time will pipe a lone take to fill the tank? A is twice as fast as b and b is thrice as fast as c. A is twice as fast as b, b is thrice as fast as c.</p>
        <h3>Hence, The Ratio Of Time Taken By A, B, C = 1 :</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Ratio of the speed of a and b = a : The journey covered by c is 54 minutes will be covered by b in: Ratio of the speed of a and c = 1 :</p>
